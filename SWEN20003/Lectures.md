## Object Oriented Features:
### Data Abstraction
**The technique of creating new data types that are well suited to an application by creating new classes.**

A class is a special kind of programmer-defined data type


### Encapsulation
**The ability to group data (attributes) and methods that manipulate the data to a single entity through defining a class.**

***Instance Variables*** are unique to each instance of the class (shown in the example below)

Class definition example:
```java
public class Circle {
	public double centreX;
	public double centreY;
	public double radius;
}
```
