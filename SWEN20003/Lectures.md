# Week 1
## Data Abstraction
**The technique of creating new data types that are well suited to an application by creating new classes.**

A class is a special kind of programmer-defined data type


# Week 2

## Encapsulation
**The ability to group data (attributes) and methods that manipulate the data to a single entity through defining a class.**

***Instance Variables*** are unique to each instance of the class (shown in the example below)

- Classes are characterised by encapsulation

```java
// Defining a class

public class Circle {
	public double centreX;
	public double centreY;
	public double radius;

	public double computeArea() {
		double area = Math.PI * radius * radius;
		return area;
	}
}
```


By creating the `Circle` class, you have created a new data type `Circle` - **Data Abstraction**

## Instantiating Classes
The declarations:
```java
Circle aCircle;
Circle bCircle;
```

Create null-references to `Circle`s - no memory is allocated.

Objects are *null* until they are *instantiated*

```java
Circle aCircle = new Circle();
```

## Getters and Setters
Generally Initialising/updating/accessing instance variables is done by defining specific methods.

These are known as **Accessor/Mutator** methods, or informally as **Getter/Setter** methods.

Getters and setters are usually used to allow information hiding, visibility control, and privacy. *Consider scenarios like input sanitisation.*

## Constructors
A constructor is a method that is run when the object is instantiated.

Constructors *must* have the same name as the class.

```java
public class Circle() {
	public double radius, x, y;
	// Constructor
	public Circle(double newRadius, double newX, double newY) {
		radius = newRadius;
		x = newX;
		y = newY;
	}
}
```

## Method Overloading
- Method overloading is when multiple methods have the same name, but are distinguished by their signature
	- Number of arguments
	- Type of arguments
	- Position of arguments
- Any method can be overloaded
- Method overloading is a type of *polymorphism* (same method - different behaviour)
- **Not to be confused with *Method Overriding***

### Polymorphism is the ability to process objects differently based on their type.

Method overloading is a form of compile-time polymorphism

What if the *variable names in the constructor* share the same names as the *instance variables?*

The `this` keyword can be used to specify that the variables refer to the current object instance.

For example:
```java
public class Circle() {
	public double radius, x, y;
	// Constructor
	public Circle(double radius, double x, double y) {
		this.radius = radius;
		this.x = x;
		this.y = y;
	}
}
```

This allows the compiler to differentiate between the instance variables and constructor arguments (local variables).

## Defining Static Variables
Static variables are shared between objects (only one copy - as they share a singular reference to memory): e.g. count of the number of objects of the type that have been created.

If we wanted to count the number of `Circle`s that we instantiate, we could add  
```java
public static int numCircles = 0; 
```
to the class definition of `Circle`.

We could then increment it whenever the `Circle` constructor method is called.

To access static variables we do:
```java
Circle.numCircles;
```

***Note: we access the variable from the class directly, not from an object instance as it's shared.***

## Static Methods
Static methods are also called directly from the class
