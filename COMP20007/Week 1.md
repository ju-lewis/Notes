## Problem Solving Steps
- Understand the problem
- Decide of computational means 
- Decide on method to use
- Decide the necessary data structures and algorithms
- Check for correctness
- Evaluate analytically
- Code it
- Evaluate empirically



## Primitive Data Structures:
### Arrays
### Linked Lists
