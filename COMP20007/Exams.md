# Mid Semester Test
## 11am 28th March, Wilson Hall
## Content: **Lecture 1 - Lecture 6**
### Lecture 1
What is a problem?
What is an algorithm?
### Lecture 2
#### Primitive data structures:
- Array
- Linked List
#### Recursive Processing:
- Binary search (bounds are reduced by 1 on each update step: lo = mid + 1 OR hi = mid - 1)
#### Fundamental Data Structures:
- Stack (FIFO)
	- **Operations**
	- CreateStack
	- Push
	- Pop
	- Top (Peek)
	- EmptyStack
- Queue (LIFO)
### Lecture 3
#### Establishing Growth Rate:
- Big O (any function in this set grows faster ) WORST CASE
- Big Theta (any function in this set grows at the same rate)
- Big Omega (any function in this set grows faster) BEST CASE

Use L'Hopital's rule for computing the ratio of growth rate

#### Computing Number of Fundamental Operations with Sums
Beware the fenceposting error when calculating sums! (REMEMBER TO INCLUDE THE BOUND)

When computing cost recursively:
- Compute a base case ( i.e. M(0) )
- Compute the recursive case in terms of itself (i.e. M(n) = M(n-1) + 1 )

Remember that all logarithms can be written as a constant multiple of any other base, so all logs have the same asymptotic growth rate.
