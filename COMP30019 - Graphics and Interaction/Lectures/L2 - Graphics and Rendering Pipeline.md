## Inverse Rendering

## Display
Images are stored in a pixel array (frame buffer) and displayed on the screen

**Frame Buffers**
- Pixel
	- Uniquely accessible point in the image
- Resolution
	- width $\times$ height (in pixels)
- Colour depth
	- Number of bits per pixel in the buffer
	- 8, 16, 24, 32
- Alpha
	- 8 bits: 0 (transparent) - 255 (opaque)

Buffer size is computed as $\text{width} \times \text{height} \times \text{colour depth}$


## Interaction

**Physical interfaces**
- Mouse, keyboard, sensor, etc.
**Logical Interfaces**
- Abstract ideas defined by the application
- Dials, sliders, etc.
