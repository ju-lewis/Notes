Rasterisation involves projecting triangles to the screen and filling pixels
- Visibility is determined by the z-buffer
- Very fast, used often in real-time rendering


Anti-aliasing is used to minimise the pixelated stepping effect (aliasing) due to sub-pixel variation in the rendered image

## Z-Buffer
Save the current minimum z-value for each *pixel*
- Acts as a depth channel for the image
