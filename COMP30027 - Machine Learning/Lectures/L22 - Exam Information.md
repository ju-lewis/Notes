# Sections

## Section A
- Short answer questions

## Section B
- Method questions
- Demonstrate your conceptual understanding of a subset of methods studied in the subject
- **Examples:**
	- Logistic regression
	- Naive bayes
	- Sum of squared errors
- Emphasis isn't necessarily on exact


## Section C
- Numeric questions
- Compute exact values (also referring to methods studied in the subject)
- **Examples:**
	- Compute conditional probabilities given a label (and a table of instances)
		- With or without smoothing
	- Predict class labels using Naive Bayes 

## Section D
- Design and application questions
- Demonstrate high level understanding of applying machine learning methods to real-world scenarios


# Topics to Study:

- [ ] Ensemble models
- [ ] Feature selection
- [ ] SVM ?
- [ ] Model evaluation (bias, variance, stratification, etc.)
- [ ] Computing values for Naive Bayes
- [ ] Computing values for entropy and mutual information
- [x] Hidden Markov Models
- [ ] Logistic regression
- [ ] Mixture models
- [ ] Generative models


Based on the 2017 practice exam the most important topics to focus on are:
- Hidden Markov models
- Model evaluation
