### Imperative _vs_ Logic _vs_ Functional
#### Imperative:
- Based on commands
- Commands have a state-altering effect
#### Logic:
- Based on finding values that satisfy a set of constraints
- Constraints may have multiple solutions (or none)
- Constraints do not have an effect
#### Functional:
- Based on evaluating expressions
- Expressions do not have an effect
