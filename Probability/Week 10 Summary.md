### Approximating Expectation

### Approximating Variance



## Bienayme's (Chebyeshev's) Inequality

$$P(\frac{|X-\mu|}{\sigma} \geq k) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}$$
Instances of a random variable become less and less likely the further they are from the mean.



## Generating Functions

### Overview

Generating functions unique describe a probability distribution.
- They can be thought of like an *encoding* of the distribution

### Probability Generating Function
### Moment Generating Function
### Central Moment Generating Function
### Cumulant Generating Function
