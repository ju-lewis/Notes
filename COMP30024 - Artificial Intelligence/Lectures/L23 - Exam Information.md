# Content
- Roughly half on "symbolic" AI, half on "probabilistic" AI

## Week 1
- Different approaches to AI
- Describe the turing test (operation)
- Characterise difficulty of common tasks
- Characterise requirements for an agent
	- Percepts, actions, environment, performance measure
- Choose and justify choice of agent type for a given problem
- Characterise environment

## Week 2
- Formulate single-state search problems
- Apply *search* strategies
- Analyse complexity of a search strategy

## Week 3
- Demonstrate operation of search algorithms
- Discuss properties of search algorithms
- Derive and compare heuristics for a problem
	- Admissibility, domination, etc.

## Week 4
- Demonstrate operation of game search algorithms
	- E.g. which nodes get pruned, optimal ordering
- Discuss and evaluate properties of game search algorithms
- Design suitable eval functions
- Explain how to search in non-deterministic games
	- Demonstrate expectiminimax

## Week 5
- Discuss opportunities for learning in game playing
- Explain differences between exploitation and exploration
- Trace the operation of MCTS on an example search tree

## Week 6
- Nothing examinable

## Week 7
- Model a given problem as a CSP
- Demonstrate operation of CSP search algorithms
	- e.g. in what order are variables or values chosen
	- minimum remaining values (most constrained variable), degree heuristic, least constraining value
	- Forward checking
	- Arc consistency
- Discuss and evaluate properties of different constraint satisfaction techniques

## Week 8
- Calculate conditional probabilities using inference by enumeration
- Use conditional independence to simplify probability calculations
- Use Bayes' rule for diagnostic problems
- *Note*: if arithmetic is complex, just simplify the expression as much as possible

## Week 9
- Formulate a belief network for a given problem domain
- Derive expression for joint probability distribution for given belief network
- Use inference by enumeration to answer a query
	- Simple *or* conjunctive queries on a given belief network

## Week 10
- Draw a *decision network*
- Understand preferences and utilities attributed to actions based on a problem description
- Compute expected utility of a given action
- Identify action that maximises expected utility (MEU)
- Asses whether acquiring information is valuable (VoI)
- Explain the effects of uncertainty and preference on decision outcomes

## Week 11
- Determine the number of degrees of freedom of a robot
	- Is it holonomic?
- Characterise sources of uncertainty in a robot application scenario
- Explain the basic concepts of localisation and mapping
- Formulate an application problem using incremental Bayes
- Model the configuration space for a simple robot
- Compare different approaches to motion planning given a configuration space
