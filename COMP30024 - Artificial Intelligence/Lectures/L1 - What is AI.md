# Defining AI

How does the mind arise from the brain?

## Definition 1: Thinking Like a Human

**Cognitive Modelling**:
- Figure out how we think by *introspection* or *experimentation*

**Self-Awareness**:
- I think, therefor I am

## Definition 2: Thinking Rationally

**The Laws of Thought**:
- Rationalism

Codifying rationalism started with Aristotle

The study of *logic* has greatly influence AI

## Definition 3: Act Like a Human

- Abstract thinking
- Problem solving
- Learning and memory
- Language and communication


# Tests for Intelligence

## The Turing Test
Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950

A human interrogates/converses with the computer via a teletype
- The aim is for the computer to *imitate* a human well enough to fool people

Turing thought a computer would pass the test by the end of the century

The Loebner Prize (Turing test) competition was held each year until 2019
the "total Turing test" allows physical objects to be passed to the machines as well as characters via tty

### Acting Rationally
The rational agent:
- Perform actions which will (most likely) achieve one's goals
Knowledge may not be perfect.
