## Key steps in Data Analysis

**Question**
- Ensure question is of interest
- Perform literature review -> has it been answered yet?
- Sharpen question following review

**EDA**
- Data is appropriate for your question
	- Bias, incompleteness, quality issues
- *Make exploratory plots*
- Refine question / collect more data

**Interpretation**
- Did analysis provide meaningful answer to question?
- Interpret totality of analyses
- Revise EDA and/or models

**Communication**
- Process and results are understood
	- Meaningful to audience




### Types of Research Questions
**Descriptive**: Seeks to summarise a characteristic of a set of data (e.g. average number of people living in suburbs)
**Exploratory**: Identify patterns, trends, or relationships
**Inferential**: Restate proposed hypothesis as a question and perform analysis with a different dataset
**Predictive**: Identify factors that can predict an outcome. (e.g. who is likely to develop cancer within the next 12 months)
**Causal**: Will changing one factor result in a change in another factor
**Mechanistic**: *How* does a change in one factor lead to a change in another
