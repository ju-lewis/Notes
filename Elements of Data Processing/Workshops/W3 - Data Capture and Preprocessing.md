## Validating Data Quality

**Semantic Errors** occur when data is inconsistent with its intended *meaning* or *purpose*, for example if temperature data was recorded in Fahrenheit but is used as if it was recorded in Celsius

**Range Errors** occur when data falls outside the expected range of values. For example if there were negative values or values well over 100 in a dataset containing peoples ages

**Format Errors** occur when data does not follow a consistent format. For example having both `dd/mm/yyyy` and `yyyy-mm-dd` to describe dates in a dataset.
