## Our aim: *Wrangle / work with data*


## Basis for data storage:
Founded upon binary
- Hexadecimal
- Octal

Textual data is reduced to binary encoding:
- ASCII
- UTF-8
- Unicode
- etc..


# Data Processing vs Data Science
Data processing:
- Operations performed on data

Data Science:
- A set of techniques used to learn something from the data


## Data Processing


### Challenges
Data varies widely in scope and quality - you need to tailor your approach to suit the data
There are many different methods you can use to analyse data
Quality of tool documentation varies


### Core of Data Processing
Input
Cleaning and Enhancement
Models and Interpretation
Output/Visualisation
Ethics of Use


# Data Types
## Qualitative (non-numerical)
Categorical vs Ordinal data:
- Categorical - no inherit ordering (nominal data)
- Ordinal data - there is an intrinsic order to the data

## Quantitative (numerical)
Handle discrete and continuous data differently:
### Discrete (Countable):
- Number of people in a city
- 
 
### Continuous:
- Share price
- Temperature
