# Task 1 - Architecture Design

## Q1. 
- Security subsystem (but we don't need to know the internal implementation)
- Credit card processor
- Inventory interface (barcode + lookup)
- Store card processor
- Sales employee database interface 
- MST UI

## Q2.
- Credit card scanning reliability
- Usability (good user interface)
- Testability (important for integrating into established system)
- Performance

## Q3.
- Reliability would have a large impact (need to consider all possible failure modes to reach desired 99.9999% reliability)
- Security integration (need to ensure no branching execution paths that circumvent security measures)
- Performance (all systems that interact with customers should have a seamless/fast user experience)


## Q4.
