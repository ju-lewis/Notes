# Part 1 - Static Domain Modelling

## Q1.1 Interpreting Domain Model
**Identify elements that shouldn't be there**
- Data types 
- Method signatures 
- MediaResource (we don't need to specify inheritance structure)
- NoSQL adapter interface
- Arrows
- Visibility modifiers

## Q1.2 Creating a Static Domain Model


**Conceptual Classes**:
- Student
- Instructor
- Assessment Item
- Submission (may want to track all submissions in a context other than just responding to the assignment for admin/logging)
