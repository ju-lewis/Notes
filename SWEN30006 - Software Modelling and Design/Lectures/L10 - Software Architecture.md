Software architecture is the large-scale organisation of elements in a software system
- A design which meets high impact system requirements, supports business logic, and is straightforward to maintain and evolve

Involves a set of significant decisions:
- **Structural elements**: what components should be in the system?
- **Interfaces**: How are the elements composed altogether?
- **Collaboration**: How should the elements work together according to business rules?
- **Composition**: How should the elements be grouped into larger subsystems?

# Architectural Analysis
**Definition**: An activity to identify factors that influence the architecture and understand their variability and priority (and resolve them)


**Goal**: To reduce risk of missing a critical factor in the *design* of a system, focus effort on high priority requirements

>[!Example] Requirement Examples
>**Functional**:
>- Auditing
>- Mail
>- Online help
>- Reporting
>- Security
>  
> **Non-Functional**:
> - Usability (aesthetics of UI)
> - Reliability
> - Performance
> - Supportability

## Priorities
- Inflexible constraints
	- Legal compliance
	- Security
- Business goals
	- Demo for clients
	- Competitor-driven window-of-opportunity
- Other goals


We need to be aware of the **architecture factor table**
- Identifies aspects of requirements and assists in prioritising them

# Logical Architecture

The large scale organisation of the software classes into *packages*, *subsystems*, and *layers*

## Layers
Coarse-grained grouping of classes, packages, or subsystems that has cohesive responsibility

A *UML Package Diagram* is used to illustrate the logical architecture
- Software elements are visually displayed in separate layered containers
- Dependencies are shown using dotted arrows

### Guidelines
- Organise large


**System Operations: SSDs and Layers**
We can decompose system sequence diagrams down into a more detailed depiction of the layers and packages being interacted with.

**Benefits**
