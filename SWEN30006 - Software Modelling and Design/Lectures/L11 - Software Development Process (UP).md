# Schedule-Oriented Design Process

## Inception
Inception is the initial short step to establish a common vision and basic scope for the project

Focusing on answering questions like:
- What is the vision?
- Feasible?
- Buy and/or build?
- Rough unreliable range of cost
- Should we proceed?

### Outcome of Inception
- Common vision
- Creation of a business case (addressing cost)
- Analysis of ~10% of use cases
- Analysis of critical non-functional requirements
- Preparation of development environment
- *Maybe*: Prototypes to clarify requirements
- Go or no go decision

It's not considered inception if:
- You take more than a few weeks
- You attempt to define most of the requirements
- You expect estimates or plans to be reliable
- You defined the architecture
- You planned the sequence of work
- You don't produce a *business case* or *vision artifact*


## Elaboration
Initial series of iterations for building core architecture
- Resolving high-risk elements
- Defining most requirements
- Estimating overall schedule


### Outcome of Elaboration
- The core, risky software architecture is programmed and tested
	- Produce an executable architecture
- The majority of requirements are discovered and stabilised
- Major risks are mitigated or retired

**Artefacts**:
- Domain model
- Design model
- Software architecture documents
- Use cases
- Working UI

Requirements to design iteratively:
- Iteratively do the right thing, do the thing right
- Provoking (inevitable) change early

Use case writing and domain modelling takes a few days
Dev prototypes can take weeks

Use cases may be spread across iterations
- Different parts or scenarios must be allocated to different iterations

### Agile Modelling and Lightweight UML Drawing
- Modelling with other developers
- Static and dynamic models
- Hand drawn or using UML tools
- Should take a few hours to a day near the start of an iteration
