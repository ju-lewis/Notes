## Role of Planetary Size
- Smaller planets cool faster (harden earlier)
- Larger planets remain warm inside, promoting volcanism and tectonics
- Larger planets have more erosion (higher gravity => atmosphere)

## Distance from the Sun
- Too close => too hot for rain, ice, snow => less erosion
- Hot planets have more difficulty retaining atmosphere
- Too far => too cold for rain => less erosion

## Effect of Rotation
- Slower rotation => less weather, erosion and weaker magnetic field


### Terrestrial bodies in our Solar System
**Mercury**
Long cliffs on Mercury's surface indicate the planet shrank early in its history

Most cratering happened in the first few billion years
A surface with many craters hasn't changed much in the last *3 billion* years

**The Moon**
Water is almost certainly present in fairly large quantities
- At the Moon's poles

Implications:
- Makes Moon favourable for exploration
	- Cuts down on launch costs
- May provide a base to explore the solar system
- Planning a Lunar Orbital Platform (**Gateway**)

Lunar Maria:
- Smooth, dark lunar Maria are less heavily clustered than lunar highlands
- Maria were made by floods of runny lava

**Venus**
Mapping the surface of Venus requires radar due to thick atmosphere
Venus has impact craters, but less than the Moon or Mars due to atmosphere
Venus has *shield volcanoes*

It's not clear whether Venus has tectonics

**Earth**
Significant volcanism and tectonic activity
Hotspots:
- A hot spot is a point where lava appears through tectonic plates
- Hawaii is a chain of islands caused by a hot spot on a moving plate

**Mars**
Mars has significant ice coverage (CO2 ice northern cap, water ice southern cap)
Confirmed volcanism (Olympus Mons)
- Many other large shield volcanoes
The system of valleys *Valles Marineris* originated from tectonics

Did water once flow on Mars?
- Gullies on crater walls suggest occasional liquid water flows from less than a million years ago

Rocks have been found that appear to have formed in water

Water has been detected deep below the surface of Mars used p-wave and s-wave modelling

A map of hydrogen content shows that Mars' low lying areas contain more water ice
