## Properties of Light

Additive colour space -> white is made of many colours

'Flow of energy' in light is measured in watts.

### Interactions of matter and light
- Emission - matter release light
- Absorption - matter absorbs light
- Transmission - transparency
- Reflection / Scattering - changes in direction but not energy



**Wave-Particle Duality**
- Wave understanding
	- Wavelength is distance between peaks
	- Frequency is the number of 'oscillations per second'
	- $c = \lambda \times f$
- Particle understanding
	- Composed of moving photons
	- Each photon has a wavelength and frequency
	- Energy depends on photon frequency
	- $E = h \times f$


## Visible Light
**Red**: ~700nm
**Green** ~550nm
**Blue** ~450nm

Human eyes detect light from ~400-700nm


### Spectroscopy
Examining how much light is emitted by something

- **Emission Line Spectrum** - dip in observed light (absorbed by object)
- **Continuous Spectrum**
- **Absorption Line Spectrum** - spike in observed light (emitted by object)


A continuous spectrum is a light spectrum without interruption (black body radiation)


An emission line spectrum are the observed emitted wavelengths from an object.
- Incident light excites electrons
- Excited electrons shift to a higher energy level
- Eventual decay results in released photon ( $\lambda \propto \frac{1}{\text{distance}}$)


An absorption spectrum is a continuous spectrum, but missing light from some frequencies
Absorption = Continuous - Emission

### Energy Levels of Molecules

Molecules can:
- Rotate
- Vibrate

These possibilities make spectra of molecules far more complicated


## Thermal (Blackbody) Radiation
- Nearly all large or dense objects emit thermal radiation
- Spectrum only depends on temperature.


**Properties**
- Hotter objects emit more light at all frequencies (per unit area)
- Hotter objects emit photons with *higher average energy*

**Analysing an actual spectrum**
![[Blackbody Radiation.png]]

Properties:
- 2 blackbodies
- CO2 absorption spectra -> atmosphere
- UV emissions indicative of hot upper atmosphere



### Doppler Shift
- Object approaching -> wavelength becomes shorter (blueshift)
- Object leaving -> wavelength stretches to becomes longer (redshift)


**Spectrum of a rotating object**:
- Spectral lines are wider
