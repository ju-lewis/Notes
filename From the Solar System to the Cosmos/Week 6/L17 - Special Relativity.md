## Frames of Reference

**Windowless Galileo's Boat**
- Can you tell if you are moving at a constant speed? - *No*

### Reference Frame Transformation
How can we transform information (time, velocity, length, mass) from one inertial reference from to another?

Galileo suggested:
- Time is invariant
- Distance is invariant
- Velocity sums as a vector





### The Speed of Light

How can we measure the speed of light?

Early attempts used *The lantern experiment*
- Two people on separate hills would turn on lanterns (1 starts it, the other turns it on when they see the light)
- Good idea, but consistently recorded $\Delta t = 0$

Later, astronomical objects were used (~ 1676 AD)
- Io's orbit around Jupiter was well understood
- Measure the difference between what time you see Io at opposite times of the year
	- Difference in distance is Earth's orbital diameter.



**Propagation of light**
For a long time it was believed light needed a medium (the ether) to propagate

#### The Michelson-Morley Experiment

Measuring interference patterns in different directions using 2 perpendicular interferometers.

If the results are identical in both directions, then there is no ether.


### Consequences of Special Relativity

**Loss of Simultaneity**

**Time Measurement**
Consider a *light-clock* on a moving object (relative to you)
- They record a 1 second period for time to travel a distance within the clock
	- The motion traced by the light is a straight line.
- We can trace the movement of a photon in the clock as a triangle's hypotenuse (due to relative movement)
	- As the distance is greater, the time must be greater to maintain the same speed

**We can relate the distance we observe the photon travels to speed and time:**

$$d_{observed} = \sqrt{d_{object \ moved}^2 + d_{light \ clock}^2}$$

$$ct=\sqrt{(tv)^2 + (t'c)^2}$$
Where $t$ is the time measured by you, $t'$ is the time measured by the moving object.


### Time Dilation

$$t' = \frac{t}{\gamma}$$

Lorentz Factor:
$$\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(\frac{v^2}{c^2})}}$$
As $\gamma > 1$, $t' < t$


>[!note] Other consequences
>- Loss of synchronisation for moving clocks (twin paradox)
>- Lengths are contracted for a moving observer
>- Moving masses are increased



Other relativistic transformations:
$$l' = \frac{l}{\gamma}$$
$$m' = m \gamma$$
