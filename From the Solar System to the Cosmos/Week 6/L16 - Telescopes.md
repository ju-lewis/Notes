## The Human Eye

The pupil is a hold that allows light to enter the eye
- The aperture changes size to let in different amounts of light

**Rods** - intensity only (very sensitive) B&W
**Cones** - colour; less sensitive


### Refraction
Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one substance into another.
- Refraction can cause parallel light rays to converge to a focus

If the incident ray matches the surface normal - no refraction occurs.


### Image formation
The *focal plane* is where the light from different directions comes into focus.
Images through a convex lens are usually upside down

A camera focuses light like an eye and captures the image with a detector (CCD)


### Limits of the Eye
- Aperture limits (photons/sec limited)
- Angular resolution (~1 arcminute)
- Wavelength range (about 400-700 nm)


### Improvements
1. Light collecting area
	1. Largest optical telescopes => radius ~10m
	2. Largest radio telescopes => radius ~300m
2. Exposure time
	1. Longer exposure times allows us to see fainter objects
	2. We need to very accurately track the object
3. Angular Resolution
	1. The minimum angular separation to be able to distinguish 2 different light sources
	![[Angular Resolution.png]]
	2. Limit of resolution comes from interference


## Telescope Design

**Refractive Telescope**
- Focuses light with *lenses*
- Needs to be very long, with large and heavy lenses

**Reflecting Telescope**
- Focuses light with *mirrors*
- Much lighter
- Can have greater diameter


## Atmospheric Effects

The best ground-based sites have:
- Dry (less water vapour and clouds)
- Dark (less light pollution)
- Calm (Less wind)
- High (Less atmosphere to see through)


**Wind:**
- Time-variable chaotic refraction (blurry images)
**Opacity**:
- Only limited *windows* with clear transmission
- Different wavelengths penetrate different distances into the atmosphere


We can solve these problems by putting telescopes in space.


### Radio Telescopes

### IR and UV Telescopes
- Similar to optical telescopes (in design)
- Need to be above most of the atmosphere to see *all* wavelengths
	- SOFITA (IR) -> on a Boeing 747
	- FUSE (UV) -> In orbit
- IR telescopes must be cooled (with liquid N2 or He)

### X-Ray Telescopes
- Focusing X-rays requires special grazing-incidence mirrors

### Gamma-Ray Telescopes
- Gamma-ray telescopes need to be in space
- Focusing gamma rays is extremely difficult


The SpIRIT satellite was built at Unimelb!
- Shoebox sized
- Launched December 2023
- Gamma and x-ray all-sky monitor for transients
