## Special Relativity - Continued
Remember: *Proper time is time measured within one's own inertial reference frame.*

**In this example:**

As the person on Earth is observing time from the ship (i.e. they check a clock on the ship to see how long has passed at the end), the ship perceives *proper time*


When an object is moving near the speed of light:
- It cannot significantly gain velocity, and thus mass increases



## Non-Inertial Reference Frames (General Relativity)

>[!note] The Equivalence Principle
>Gravitational acceleration and acceleration due to a force are equivalent.


Gravity and space-time deformation.
- Matter (source of gravity) deforms space-time
- Greater mass -> Greater deformation
- Light no longer travels in a straight line

Space-time curvature depends on **mass density**.


Inside an accelerating from (or equivalently gravitational field) light is bent
- The stronger the acceleration/field, the stronger the bending
- The slower the time compared to an inertial reference frame.

**Doppler shift in a gravitational field**:
- Blue shift going into the field (energy increases)
- Red shift going out of the field (energy decreases)


GPS requires general relativity to operate correctly!
