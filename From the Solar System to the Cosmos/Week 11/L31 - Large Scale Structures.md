## Measuring Distances

### Ladder Step 1 - Radar Ranging
Send radar signal to a hard surface, wait to receive it back
- Incredibly accurate
- Only works with nearby objects

### Ladder Step 2 - Nearby Stars
Nearby stars position relative to background changes as earth orbits around the Sun

Parsec = PARallax arcSECond $\approx$ 3.26 light years

*Current Limit:*
- Current limit is around 100,000 parsecs

### Ladder Step 3 - Distant Stars
Main sequence fit idea
- Stars in a cluster are typically born at a similar time
Fit the cluster to an HR diagram

Temperature/Colour gives stellar type, in turn mass and absolute luminosity
- Can infer distance from observed brightness

*Current Limit:*
- Nearest galaxies

### Ladder Step 4 - Nearby Galaxies
Some variable stars (like **Cepheids**) have tight relation between *period of oscillation* and *absolute luminosity*

Measuring period and observed brightness allows us to infer distance

*Current Limit:*
- Nearby galaxies (need to be able to identify individual stars)

### Ladder Step 5 - Distant Galaxies
#### Method 1:
Approximate scaling law for disk galaxies *Tully-Fisher* relation
- Rotational velocity is related to absolute luminosity

Rotation rate and observed brightness gives us distance

*Current Limit:*
- Spiral galaxies a few billion light years away

#### Method 2:
White-dwarf binary supernovae (Type 1a)
- Explosions almost always emit the same energy, giving us a distance indication

## Redshift

Some of the redshift (and blueshift) is actually from the relative movement of galaxies, but most of what we observe is cosmological redshift (not doppler)

$$v = H_0\times d$$
Hubble's original measurement for $H_0$ was $500km s^{-1} Mpc ^{-1}$, this was far off the actual value of around $70$, due to incorrect distance measurements


## Distribution of Galaxies

### Clustering
Distribution is not uniform due to gravitational attraction

Galaxies are found in:
- Groups  - Small number of gravitationally bound galaxies
- Clusters - up to 10,000 or more galaxies


#### Local Group:
- Large Galaxies
	- Milky Way
	- Andromeda
- Medium Galaxies
	- Trinagulum (M33)
	- Magellenic Clouds
	- ~6 others
- Dwarfs
	- ~50 that orbit large galaxies


### The Cosmic Web

Voids
Clusters
Filaments
- Connect clusters

Galaxies trace out the dark matter
- Due to gravitational attraction (over-dense regions attract more matter)
