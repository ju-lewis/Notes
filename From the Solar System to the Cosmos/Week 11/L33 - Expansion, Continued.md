## How is expansion rate behaving?

**3 Possible Behaviours**
- Acceleration
- Deceleration
- Coasting



The initial assumption was that gravitation would slow the expansion rate, and eventually cause the collapse of the Universe
- Attractive force
- Deceleration


Or maybe there could be repulsive force *increasing* the rate of expansion
- Acceleration



**Gravity and the decelerating Universe**
Gravity is the only force that acts on large enough scales to be relevant
- Is there enough mass in the universe to impact expansion rate significantly?




### Determining which 'path' the Universe is following


We can use measurements of distant supernovae to determine the behaviour of the universe in the past
- Redshift, apparent brightness, and intrinsic luminosity allow us to determine distance (lookback time)

It was noticed that the supernovae were fainter than expected
- Further away than expected

The universe was decelerating until about 5 billion years ago (z $\approx$ 0.5)
- But it has been accelerating since then


## Dark Energy
Everything we understand in the Universe has *decelerating* effect, so the impact of dark energy must be immense

Dark energy must be the primary constituent of the Universe today!
- Dark matter is the second largest component



### What is Dark Energy?

A leading hypothesis is the *cosmological constant* (negative pressure of space)

The density of dark energy remains *constant* even as the universe expands
- DE grows with time!

So the relative density of dark energy compared to dark matter increases over time

>DM overpowered DE, until a size threshold was reached, then DE overcame the attractive force of DM



### Understanding observations with a spacetime diagram

We can see within the light cone, and as we move forwards in time, the light cone shifts up and we can see further away 

Since our vision will always be finite, the universe extends (perhaps infinitely) beyond our 'light cone', but we cannot know.
