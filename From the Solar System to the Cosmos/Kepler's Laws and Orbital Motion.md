## Elliptical Orbits

Features of an ellipse:
- Foci
- Major axis - longest axis
- Semimajor axis - half of the longest axis
- Minor axis - short axis
- Ellipticity - $1 - \frac{b}{a}$
- Eccentricity - $\sqrt{1 - (\frac{b}{a})^2}$


## Kepler's Laws
### Law 1:
All orbits around the Sun are elliptical, with the Sun at a focus.

### Law 2 - Law of Equal Areas:
As a planet move around its orbit, it sweeps out equal areas in equal times.
- Approaching perihelion - speeds up
- Approaching aphelion - slows down

### Law 3:
More distant planets orbit the Sun at slower average speeds. Orbital period is proportional to average distance from the Sun.

In our solar system:
$$p^2 = a^3$$

## Historical Understanding of Motion:
### *Galileo's* Theory of Relativity
- Free motion is constant in speed and direction
- A freely falling body is constantly accelerated
- It is not possible to tell if a 'vehicle' is in constant motion.

Modulus Operandi
### *Newton's* Laws of Motion
### *Einstein's* Special and General Theories of Relativity



A rotating body has *angular momentum* (as opposed to *linear momentum*)
