## Determining Stellar Mass

We *can't* determine the mass of a single star


Luckily, binary stars are quite common (~80%)
- mass -> gravity -> motion


**Newton's Version of Kepler's Third Law**
$$p^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{GM}a^3$$


What is the possible mass range for stars?
- Most massive stars: ~120 $M_{sun}$
	- Anything larger is destroyed by pressure of fusion
- Smallest stars: $~0.08 \ M_{sun}$
	- Anything smaller can't maintain fusion


### Main Sequence Stars


More massive stars:
- Hotter temps
	- Higher gravitational pressure -> greater T
- Higher luminosity



*Stars with a greater mass have shorter lifetimes*
- Available hydrogen is greater but luminosity is *much much* higher

Massive stars are very rare (in main sequence)


## Determining Stellar Age

Cluster stars are all at the same distance
- They're also roughly the same age


### Star Clusters

**Globular clusters**
- 100,000 - 1,000,000 stars
- Tightly gravitationally bound
- Typically quite old


**Main Sequence Turnoff**
- Higher mass stars leave main sequence fastest

As stars run out of hydrogen fuel they move off the main sequence:
- Cool slightly
- Become brighter

Main sequence turnoff tells us cluster age
