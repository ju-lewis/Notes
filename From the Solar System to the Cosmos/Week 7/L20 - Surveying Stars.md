## How do other stars compare to our Sun?


### H-R Diagrams

Graphing *Luminosity* against *Temperature*

X Axis: Temperature *Hot -> Cool* (left to right)
Y Axis: Luminosity *Low-> High* (bottom to top)


Luminosity is an intrinsic property of an object - observation doesn't matter

*Brightness* depends on both luminosity and observation distance
- Apparent magnitude

So we can't just use brightness - we need to know distance.

#### Types of Stars

**Main Sequence**
Stripe of dim+cool stars to bright+hot stars

**Giants**
Group of moderately bright but cool stars

**Supergiants**
Extremely luminous, still quite cool

**White Dwarfs**
Very dim, very hot


Luminosity depends on both *temperature* and *surface area*

$$R^2 \propto \frac{L}{T^4}$$

### Determining Distance

#### Parallax Distance
Looking at a focal point, we can examine how the 'background' shifts as we move

As Earth orbits around the Sun, we can look at a star and examine how its background changes over a year.


Distance (parsecs) = 1 / parallax angle (arcsec)

1 parsec = the distance at which an object would have a parallax of 1 arcsecond
- *par*allax + arc*sec*ond

Smaller parallax => larger distance



$$\text{Apparent Brightness} = \frac{\text{Luminosity}}{4\pi \text{ distance}^2}$$
So
$$\text{Luminosity} = \text{Apparent Brightness} \times 4\pi \times \text{ distance}^2$$

So we can now determine luminosity for our H-R Diagram! *But how we determine temperature?*


### Determining Stellar Temperature

- Blackbody radiation peak - (Wein's Law), good in theory, difficult in practice
- Presence of spectral absorption lines
	- Atoms and molecules are fragile
	- If there are lots of absorption lines then there are lots of different types of atoms/molecules
		- Hence temperature is lower



### Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin
**Temperature is the key**

Showed that *surface temperature* was the big factor (not composition)
Higher temps = more atoms ionised, molecules dissociated
Cooler temps = more atoms and molecules can survive.

`O B A F G K M` -> decreasing temperature

**Stellar classes**
O, B = hottest, bluest
A, F, G = middle type (yellow Sun is a G2 star)
K, M = coolest, reddest

Each class is subdivided into 10 subclasses
