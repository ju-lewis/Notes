## Galaxy Morphology

### Spirals
**Disks**
Contains spiral arms

Gas and dust
Extremely thin (~1000 ly) compared to diameter (~ 100,000 ly)

Spiral arms are sites of new star formation (appear blue and purple -> young stars)

**Spheroids**
Bulges + Halos

Some spirals are *barred*


### Ellipticals
Contain very few young stars
- Very little cool gas/dust

Reddish colour = old stars
- Red giants, red main sequence

Ellipticals *don't have a disk*


### Irregular
Galaxies in:
- Formation?
- Transition?
- *Failed*?

Often contain lots of star births

Examples:
- Sagittarius Dwarf - no gas / star formation (very diffuse)
- Small Magellenic Cloud (Lots of star formation)
- Cartwheel galaxy
	- Post merger

## Edwin Hubble's Classification Scheme

Hubble came up with the **'tuning fork'** diagram..

## Nebulae

### Warm gas and dust

~(100-1000s) K

*Absorb* visible and UV light
*Transparent* to longer wavelengths
*Emits* IR light

### Hot gas

T ~ 10,000 K
Heated by young stars

Ionization nebulae


### *Really* hot particles


Bubbles of hot gas blown out by supernovae

*Superbubble* - combined effect of many massive stars' winds and supernovae


T = 10^5 - 10^7 K

## Additional Components of Galaxies


**Stellar Black Holes**
- Well understood origin
- Come from large stars dying (Core collapse past neutron degeneracy pressure)

**Supermassive Black Holes**

$10^6 - 10^9 M_{Sun}$ 


*Active Galactic Nuclei*
When growing:
- In the process of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
- Gas clouds fall into the core of the galaxy
	- Forms accretion disk around SMBH
- Inner regions of formed accretion disk are incredibly hot


AGN light comes from hot accretion disk outside of the event horizon of a SMBH
More mass "eaten" by the BH = brighter
Brightest AGNs consume around 1 solar mass per year


SMBHs are invisible, but we can spot matter falling in

### Quasars

QUAsi-StellAR objects
- First noted in early 1960s

Appear as extremely *blue* stars
- Must be very hot

Brightness variations rapid and dramatic
- Must be fairly small

Some have very high redshifts (*at large distances*)
- Must be very bright

Emitted radio jets are far larger than the galaxy.



### How are SMBHs found?

We don't know anything larger than $10^3-10^4 M_{Sun}$ black holes form
- Combining lower mass black holes maxes out around here

Will the Milk Way ever become an active galaxy?
- Maybe
- Sagittarius A* is large enough to power a modest quasar
- Not really enough gas in the inner galaxy to feed a SMBH into AGN activity

*However*
we have observed giant gamma ray bubbles above and below the milky way
- Implying previous AGN activity


**Remaining Questions:**
- Do all galaxies have SMBHs?
	- *Probably all large ones*
- How do you form SMBHs?
- Where are all the intermediate mass BHs?
- What is the "*duty cycle*" of AGN activity?
	- How often are they turned on vs dormant?
