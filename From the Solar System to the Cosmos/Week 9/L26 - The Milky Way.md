## Milky Way
We can see a greater concentration of stars by looking along the disk of the Milky Way

### History of Discovery
Galileo realised in 1610:
- Galaxy is composed of a huge number of stars
- Stars are clustered

**William and Caroline Herschel (1785)**
- Counted stars along 683 lines of sight
- DIdn't know distances but made a map 
	- Assuming stars have roughly the same luminosity
	- Concluded the Sun is at the centre
- *Issues with the inference*
	- Predominantly observing stars in local Sun neighbourhood
		- Distributed isotropically
	- They were assigning the wrong distance to the few bright (and distant) stars

**Harlow Shapley (1915)**
- Observed globular clusters
- Measured distances with *Cepheid Variables*
- Mapped based on the known luminosity and their apparent brightness
	- Essentially our modern picture of the galaxy


Contains roughly 100 billion stars
100,000 light year diameter


Multi-wavelength observations give us a good picture of the different processes occurring across the galaxy
- It also shows us the *gas recycling process* occurring

**Gas Recycling**
- Lower mass stars return gas
- High mass stars have strong stellar winds that blow gas away
- X rays from hot has in supernova reveal newly made heavy elements
	- Multiple supernovae create huge hot bubbles that can blow out of the disk
	- Gas clouds cooling in the halo can 'rain' back down on the disk
- Eventually the cool gas can reform into molecular hydrogen
	- Stars can then form again from this (slightly metal enriched) gas



In the early 1900s we weren't sure if "spiral nebulae" were inside the Milky Way or outside it

### Types of Galaxies
**Spirals**
- Disk
	- Contains spiral arms
	- Gas and dust
	- Extremely thin (~1000 ly) compared to diameter (~ 100,000 ly)
- Bulge and Halo
	- Globular clusters

Orbits of stars in the bulge and halo have random orientations
Stars in disk orbit in the same plane
- Stars oscillate up and down (due to gravity)

**Ellipticals**
**Irregular**


They can also all be dwarf galaxies
