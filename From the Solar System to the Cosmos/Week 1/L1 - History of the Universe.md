## Basic Timeline:
**Within a fraction of a second:**
- Rapid expansion occurs
- The visible universe is around the size of a grapefruit
**After 1 Second:**
- The LHC simulates conditions that occurred around this time
**100 - 1000 Seconds:**
- Nuclear fusion begins - hydrogen, helium, and lithium form
**300,000 Years:**
- We can detect radiation from as far back as this point.
- Before this, the universe is opaque
**A few hundred *million* years:**
- Matter clumps together under its own gravity
- First protogalaxies are formed containing the first stars
**A few billion years:**
- Expansion of the universe began to accelerate again at this point
- The acceleration is caused by *dark energy*
**9 Billion years:**
- The Sun, along with all planets and asteroids, is formed
**10 Billion years:**
- The first life forms on Earth
**13.7 Billion years:**
- Today
### Future:
**20 Billion Years:**
- The Sun's outer layers will expand as it turns into a Red Giant
- Expansion of the Universe will continue to accelerate.
**10^100 Years:**
- Stars no longer form
- Protons decay
- Black holes evaporate
- Universe reaches its ultimate fate as cold, dead, empty space, containing only radiation - which too will eventually disperse



t=380,000 years, z~1100 (Redshift)
- Dark energy existed, but was unimportant
- There was roughly 5 times more dark matter than baryonic matter


## Models for the Expansion of the Universe:
 ![[Expansion Models.png]]
As the universe ages, denser regions draw in more matter and 'clump' together.

Stars form in the densest regions from clouds of dust and gas.


## Motion Experienced By Earth:
### 1. Rotation of Earth
### 2. Earth's Orbit around the Sun
### 3. The Sun moves with local stars
### 4. The Sun orbits around the centre of the Milky Way
### 5. The Milky Way moves in the Local Group
### 6. Local Group moving towards Virgo Cluster

**How do we determine our 'final velocity'?**
With respect to the cosmic background radiation, we're moving at around $369km/s$
