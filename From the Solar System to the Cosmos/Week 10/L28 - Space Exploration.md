## Exploring our Solar System

### Primary Challenges
**Vacuum**
**Radiation**
**Extreme Temperatures**
**Microgravity**
**Distance**
**Micrometeorites**
**Human Factors**

### Historical Failures

**Ariane 5 Maiden Launch**
- Conversion from a 64-bit float to a 16-bit signed integer caused overflow in navigation software.
**Mars Climate Orbiter**
- Mismatch between newton-seconds and pound-force seconds caused a collision into Mars' surface
**Schiaparelli EDM Lander**
- Sensor glitch caused the system to think the lander was below the surface, causing early parachute release.
**Hubble Space Telescope Spherical Aberration**
- An error in the manufacturing of Hubble's primary mirror led to initial blurry images


### Challenges to specific mission types

#### LEO
- Orbital decay
- Van Allen radiation belt
- Debris
#### GEO
- Requires constant adjustment

#### Lunar Missions
- Abrasive lunar dust
- Extreme temperatures
- Void communication zones

#### Mars and Beyond
- Thin atmospheres
- Extended isolation (communication delays)
- Alien environments


Testing is paramount in space exploration.
- Cost of testing is far lower than cost of failure.
