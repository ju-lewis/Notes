Recall that Hubble's understanding of galactic evolution was actually reversed.


## How Many Galaxies?
We can count galaxies from the Hubble eXtreme deep field
- From an image with a 23 day exposure time

We can then extrapolate this based on an assumption of homogeneity
- $5,500 \times 13,000,000 = 70$ billion galaxies in the universe

>[!note]
>Easy to remember: *100 billion* galaxies, each with *100 billion* stars

We can map light and colours into (approximate) distances and stellar population properties.


### Galaxy Stellar Mass Function

Uncertain measurement, but clearly **small galaxies** (~10 billion stars) are $100\times$ to $1000\times$ more common than giant galaxies

Most stars were formed before the Universe was half the current age.

## Formation
1. Giant gas clouds collapse
2. Disk formation occurs
	1. Angular momentum determines whether it's a disk or a spheroid
3. Hierarchical growth
	1. Multiple gas clouds collide together
	2. Large galaxies are formed out of smaller galaxies
	3. Old stars orbit in random directions (halo)
	4. Small galaxies and gas clouds are continually "eaten" by larger galaxies

**What causes the arms?**
Spiral Density Waves
- Wave of star formation and molecular clouds collapse
- Long lasting
- *Doesn't carry matter*

Gas clouds approach 'over-dense' regions
- They're compressed
- Young stars are created
- Blue stars burn out before they leave the arm
- Smaller stars live long enough to exit the arm and enter elliptical galactic orbits


Galaxy collisions separate stars from gas
- Gas clouds collide and compress
- Stars continue undisturbed

When collisions occur, angular momentum is likely to 'cancel out', given that it is unlikely for the galactic planes to be aligned
- Results in elliptical galaxies
