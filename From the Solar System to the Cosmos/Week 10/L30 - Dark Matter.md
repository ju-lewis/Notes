## How Massive is the Universe?

Simple
- Compute the mass of a galaxy
- Multiply by the number of galaxies in the universe

### Galaxy Composition

Stars
Planets
- Tiny contribution
Gas and Dust
- Primarily in spiral galaxies
Supermassive black holes
- Likely in all galaxies

### Galaxy mass via light
Spectral type -> mass of star
Count the number of stars of various types from light and colours of galaxy, convert to masses in units of Solar mass

Estimate the mass of gas and dust clouds

This doesn't provide a great estimate ($~10^{10} M_{Sun}$ )


### Alternative method: Dynamic mass
Use orbital speeds to find mass

$$v_{circ} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$
We can use the orbital period of stars to determine mass.

Distributed mass makes this a little complicated, however:
- Mass *inside* the orbit can be trated as a point at the centre
- Mass *outside* orbit cancels out

Hence,
$$M = \frac{v^2R}{G}$$
But how can we measure velocities?
We can use the doppler effect, and the resulting red/blue shifting

#### Rotation velocity from Doppler Shift
A rotating object has 2 components of Doppler Shift:
- Centre of mass velocity (Applies to all regions)
- Line of sigh rotation velocities

We can derive the rotation velocity by comparing shifts relative to the motion of the entire object

Velocity profiles $\iff$ mass profiles
- Isothermal spheres 

We expect a falling rotation curve, as the mass (that we observe) decreases (luminosity decreases)

>[!note]
>Rotation curves are graphs plotting orbital velocity against distance from galactic centre.


**HOWEVER**
*No* galaxy exhibits a falling rotation curve (velocity against distance), rather it continues to rise approaching the edge of the disk.
- This means there is a huge amount of matter that *doesn't interact with light*

### Quantifying mass with gravitational lensing
We can estimate the amount of dark matter in a galaxy by comparing the mass computed through gravitational lensing to the luminous mass observed


**Galaxy Clusters**
Most massive gravitationally-bound objects in the universe
Clusters acts as large gravitational lenses


Overall we get the mass composition of galaxies:
- 84% darks matter
- 12% Gas
- 4% Stars


## Properties of Dark Matter

While we don't know what dark matter is, we do know some of its properties

- It has mass and produces gravity
- It doesn't absorb or emit light in any way
	- No electromagnetic interactions with baryons
- There is ~$5\times$ more dark matter than regular matter


### Current Best Candidate(s): WIMPs
WIMPs = Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
Elemental particles which have mass but don't interact with regular matter

Possible examples:
- Neutrinos - but too hot, not massive enough
- **Neutralinos** - Massive neutral particle with 10-1000x the proton mass


If dark matter is everywhere, why doesn't it affect the orbits of planets?
- Dark matter doesn't concentrate the way regular matter does. It's only important at very large (galactic) scales

### Dark Matter Distribution

As DM is smoothly distributed throughout the galaxy, there would be about 50 particles of dark matter per m^3
