A star's life is a struggle between gravity, *wanting to crush it*, and thermal pressure, *wanting to expand it*

In the end, gravity always wins.

## Low Mass Stars (< 2 Solar masses)
### Stage 1 - Main Sequence

90% of a star's life is spent on the Main sequence
- Fusing hydrogen into helium (T ~ 15 million K)

**What happens when Hydrogen runs out?**
- Helium fusion requires >100 million K
- Fusion stops -> gravity causes collapse
- Temperatures start to increase
	- Hydrogen fusion begins in the *outer layers* of the star


While the core is collapsing, the outer layers are expanding
- Forms red giant (> 100x original radius, 1000x more luminous)

### Stage 2 - Red Giants

No more core fusion! (thermostat is broken)

Eventually the core heats up enough to begin Helium (triple-alpha fusion)
$$^4He + \ ^4He + \ ^4He \rightarrow \ ^{12}C + \text{ energy}$$
Fusion into $^8Be$ does occur, but it's unstable and instantly decays ($10^{-6}$) seconds, so another $^4He$ nuclei must hit to form carbon (stable).

### Stage 3 - Horizontal Branch

Happily fusing helium to carbon as a *horizontal branch star*

- Core stabilises, luminosity decreases
- Outer layers stopped being pushed out

Gravitational equilibrium is restored. (7x original radius)

### Stage 4 - Double-shell Red Giant
Carbon core starts collapsing and heats up (needs 600 million K)

*Two* fusing shells
- Inner shell fusing He -> C
- Outer shell fusing H -> He

Energy generation becomes much higher *again*

Star becomes *very luminous double-shell fusing Red Giant*


Can the core reach 600 million Kelvin to begin fusion carbon?

**Electron Degeneracy Pressure**
- Quantum physics tells us two particles can't have the same position and energy
- Restricts how 'tightly packed' particles can become

Once all possible 'combinations' of quantum position and energy are used, the system becomes degenerate
- prevents further collapse of the core
- This pressure depends only on density!

**Low mass stars can *never* fuse carbon into heavier elements**

### Stage 5 -Stellar Nebula (Low mass stars)

Helium hiccups
- He fusion is very sensitive to temperature
- Explosions blow off large portions of hydrogen in outer atmosphere

Much of the mass is gone
No pressure, temperature drops (starts incredibly high)


### Stage 6 - White Dwarf
Our Sun will have a final density of around 1 ton/cm^3



**Neucleosynthesis**
- Big Bang produced H, He
- Low mass stars can form He and C
- Where does everything else come from?? - High mass stars.




## High Mass Stars ( > 8 Solar masses)


### Stage 1 - Main Sequence
Much shorter than low mass stars


### Stage 2 - Double-Shell Red Giants
- Can overcome electron degeneracy pressure
- Elements are formed via *helium capture*
- Elements are created going up the periodic table in steps of 2 protons
	- 4 Mass units (Helium nuclei)


### Stage 3 - Onion Model
- Concentric shells of increasing temperature and pressure produce heavier and heavier elements.
- The energy created by each shell sustains pressure

Succesive shells are hotter, denser, and shorter lived
- H -> He lasts 8.1 Myr
- Si -> Fe lasts *11 days* (at 3.3 BILLION K)

Iron nucleus is the most tightly bound
Iron doesn't release much energy through either fission or fusion

Electron degeneracy pressure supports the star for a bit
- until iron core gets too heavy

Eventually when the pressure is large enough, iron atoms get compressed into *pure neutrons*

protons + electrons -> neutrons + neutrinos

>[!note] 
>The ENTIRE CORE COLLAPSE takes only *0.01* seconds

The collapse is stopped very abruptly by neutron degeneracy pressure.

This causes a massive explosion (supernova)
- *All* heavier elements are produced in mere seconds.


Exploding remnants of massive star disperses heavy elements through the galaxy.
Inside may be a *neutron star*
