**Properties**
- Distance - Determined from parallax (for close stars)
- Luminosity - Inferred from apparent brightness and temperatures
- Temperature - Spectral classification (OBAFGKM)
- Radius - Infer from luminosity and temperature ($L = R^2T^4$)
- Mass - Observe something orbiting the star (e.g. another star in a binary system)
- Age - Cluster age is determined from main sequence turn-off point


## Birth of Stars

Where and how are stars forming?

*Empty space is not empty*
- Interplanetary space -> ~10 particles/cm^3
- Interstellar space -> ~1 particle/cm^3
- Intergalactic space -> ~6\*10^-6 particles/cm^3


Interstellar dust clouds have a density of around 1000 particles/cm^3
- Gravity causes cloud to collapse
- Fusion begins when cloud becomes very compressed

>[!tldr] Pressure of Gases
>Pressure originates from particles colliding with surfaces.

### Gravity vs pressure:
- Gravity pulls particles together
- Pressure pushes gases apart

1. Gravity contracts cloud -> density and pressure increases
2. Pressure expands cloud -> density (and pressure) decrease

"Jeans" Mass determines if the cloud will collapse or not
$$M_{Jeans} = 18M_{Sun}\sqrt{\frac{T^3}{n}}$$
Where $T$ is temperatures, $n$ is density

$M_{Jeans} > M_{cloud}$ => collapse
$M_{Jeans} < M_{cloud}$ => no collapse


Higher temp  -> higher Jeans mass (harder to collapse)
Higher density -> lower Jeans mass (easier to collapse)


**What starts the collapse?**
- Supernova
- Colliding clouds
- Turbulence in galaxy
- Spontaneous cooling

Gas cools via radiation (at ~30K the cloud must have >171$M_Sun$ to collapse)
- Temperature stays nearly constant as density increases
	- *Gravity stays 'winning'* until runaway collapse occurs


Why do gas clouds flatten into disks?
- Collisions 'average out' vertical velocity on average

This forms an **Accretion Disk**
- Common phenomenon in solar system


### Protostars

The cloud core becomes a protostar
- Centre is opaque
- Very inefficient cooling

Heat can no longer escape isotropically, resulting in *jets*
- Heat escape from a single point (perpendicular to the disk)

Once a protostar becomes opaque it starts to heat up
- A solid object cools off and fades as it radiates energy
- A gas cloud held together by its own gravity contracts as it radiates, growing ever hotter


#### Progression into Main Sequence
Protostars move from *far bottom right* on an H-R diagram *upwards and to the left*
- Become hotter and brighter
Temperature stabilizes
- Moves downward
Fusion begins, protostar collapses further
- Moves slightly *along* main sequence (left)
Stellar thermostat stabilises temperature
- H -> He fusion continues

Protostars of different masses follow different tracks towards the main sequence
- Massive stars take 10,000s of years
- Small stars take 100,000,000s of years

Massive star formation can affect the formation of smaller stars
- Trigger collapse
- *Carve out* holes in dense molecular clouds
	- Creates 'wind'


### Initial Mass Function
How much of the mass of a star forming cloud goes into forming what kind (mass) of star?
- Probability function
>[!note] Initial Mass Function
>Probability of a star of a given mass being formed.

For every massive O-star that is born, there are ~200 low-mass M-stars formed
- However, O-stars have 10,000,000 times the luminosity of an M-star

So blue O-stars dominate the light produced



We can reconstruct the star formation history of a galaxy by looking at the light emitted
- Lots of blue light -> Recent formation (blue stars appear early, move off main sequence early)
- Red light -> No formation for a long time
