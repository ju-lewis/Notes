>[!note] Asteroids vs Comets
>Asteroids were formed from leftover *rocky* debris (*inner* solar system)
>Comets were formed from leftover *icy* debris (*outer* solar system)

Asteroids are cratered and **not round**.
- Their gravitational field is not great enough to compress them

# Asteroids

## Asteroid Orbits
Most asteroids orbit in the *asteroid belt* between Mars and Jupiter

**Orbital Resonances**
- Asteroids in orbital resonance with Jupiter experience period gravitational tugs
- This creates gaps in the asteroid belt.
- Tidal forces (from Jupiter) prevented a planet from forming.


## Terminology
- **Meteorite** - a rock (stony/iron/both) from space that hits Earth
- **Meteor** - The bright trail left by particles hitting the atmosphere


**Frequency of Impacts**
- Small impacts happen almost daily (~44,000kg)
- Impacts large enough to cause mass extinction happen millions of years apart

The most recent mass extinction was the K/T extinction 65 million years ago



## The importance of Iridium
- Iridium is incredibly rare on Earth, but common in meteorites.
- A global layer of iridium was found from around 65 million years ago

# Comets
"The icy counterparts to asteroids"

The nucleus of a comet is a 'dirty snowball'

Most comets remain frozen in the outer atmosphere, and melt when they approach the Sun - creating a tail.

A *coma* is the atmosphere that comes from a comet's heated nucleus.
A plasma *tail* is gas escaping from the coma, pushed by solar win
A *dust tail* is pushed by photos

Tails can be over 100,000km long!


## Life of a Comet
- Small icy planetesimals formed between Jupiter and Neptune
- Gravitational interacts with jovian planets perturbed orbits
	- Could be sent into the inner solar system -> they melt
	- Could be sent into the outer solar system (Oort cloud) -> deep freeze
- Occasionally perturbed by a passing star

>[!note] 
The eccentricity of many comet's orbits is almost 1! (effectively a straight line)

Only a tiny number of comets enter the inner solar system.

**Oort Cloud** - Random orbits up to 50,000 AU away
**Kuiper Belt** - Orderly orbits to about 100 AU away
