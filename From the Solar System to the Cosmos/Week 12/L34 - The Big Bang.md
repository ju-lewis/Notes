The observed expansion naturally leads to a beginning
1. The universe had a beginning
2. The universe began in a hot, dense state
3. The universe has been expanding and cooling since then

![[Time vs Temp.png]]

**Some important ideas**:
- Earlier times = higher energy (*temp*)
- As soon as something *can* happen, it *does* happen (chemical reactions)
- As soon as something *can't* happen, it stops happening


## Did the Big Bang Really Happen?
- 14 billion years ago
- Mostly unobservable
- Conditions we can't recreate

### Observational Evidence
- Galaxies "moving away from us" (observed movement resulting from expansion of spacetime)
- Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) - universe was once hot and uniform
- Abundances of atomic elements  - H and He are common, all others are quite rare


### Cosmic Microwave Background
When we look extremely far back, we observe an "edge wall" - where light is no longer transmitted
- Before this the universe was opaque due to the presence of plasma (photons interacting with free electrons)
- *Surface of Last Scattering*

After about 400,000 years (temp $\approx$ 3000K), the universe became transparent
- Photons from this period became extremely redshifted


In 1990 a perfect blackbody spectrum was observed with a peak at 2.275K
- This was the exact expected peak given the redshift of the photons

#### Was the universe completely uniform?
No. There were tiny temperature fluctuations that eventually led to density differentials which grew under gravity

We observe doppler redshift (and blueshift) due to our movement towards Andromeda
- We can mathematically reduce this

We can also remove the impact of our own galaxy's radio emissions


### Atomic Abundance

#### Planck Era 
*t = 0*
Quantum gravity - mostly speculations
- Extremely high temperatures (T=$10^{32}K$)

#### Rapid Growth (Inflation)
$t \approx 10^{-34}s$
Speculative physics
- String and electro-weak force decouple
- Universe grows in size by $10^{40}$ times!

#### Particle Era
$t \lt 0.001s$
Temperature so high that photons produce exotic particle pairs
- e.g. quarks-antiquarks

#### Formation of Nuclei
$t \approx 0.001s$
Quarks (and antiquarks) form baryonic particles (and antiparticles) respectively

#### Era of Nucleosynthesis
$t \lt 3$ minutes
Formation of hydrogen atoms begins

Neutrons are not stable unless bound inside a nucleus
- We end up with far more protons than neutrons (7:1)
- Neutrons that are still present bond with protons to form helium nuclei

This imbalance in presence results in the ratio between hydrogen and helium still present in the universe today
- 3:1 hydrogen:helium

Today we observe:
- H = 74%
- He = 24%
- All others < 2%

Heavier elements weren't formed because because the formation of helium caused too much cooling to continue fusion
- Cores of stars are hot enough, however


### Properties of the Universe
We observe isotropy and homogeneity
- On large scales

**How is the Universe Curved?**
We can use the CMB to determine this
- By examining the tiny fluctuations

It turns out we live in a flat universe
- Euclidean geometry
