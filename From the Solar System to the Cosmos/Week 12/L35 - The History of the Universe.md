## Big Bang Recap
[[L34 - The Big Bang]]

At 0.001s annihilation of particles and anti-particles occurred

**Why do we now see very little antimatter?**
- We don't observe annihilation of matter and antimatter

Seemingly the formation of matter and antimatter is asymmetric
- Favouring matter


### Period of Inflation
The rapid expansion of the universe resulted in the *curved* spacetime of the early universe 'flattening out' into the homogenous, isotropic, flat universe we observe today

Universal inflation helps explain the homogeneity and isotropy of the modern universe, as all 'parts of the universe' were in contact at some stage, and thus evolve in the same manner - despite being separated now



### Particle Era
[[L34 - The Big Bang#Particle Era]]
"Quark soup" ($10^{-3}s$)

Very slight excess of matter vs antimatter


### Cosmic Microwave Background
[[L34 - The Big Bang#Cosmic Microwave Background]]

**Recombination**
$t \approx 380,000$ years

The universe changes from a plasma composition (opaque to light)
to be composed of discrete atoms (transparent)
- This is the earliest period we can *directly* observe with *photons*
	- We can potentially examine earlier using gravitational waves


The universe has roughly expanded by $1000\times$ since then, so we observe a $1000\times$ redshift
- $3000K$ photons $\to$ $3K$ photons
- We observe a consistent $2.75K$ CMB

There are slight variations
- variations $\approx 10 \mu K$ (0.001% contrast)
- Hot-spots were a requirement for the formation of matter through gravitational attraction
	- "seeds of galaxies"
- Quantum fluctuations
	- Occur probabilistically

Fluctuations occurred in dark matter, over time regular matter fell into the gravitational potential wells


### Formation of the First Stars and Galaxies

We believe the first stars and proto-galaxies formed after about 600 Myr
- Redshift $\approx$ 50
- Re-ionisation occurs after the formation of these objects
	- Energy from stars and galaxies turns neutral hydrogen in intergalactic space into ionised particles

We don't have observations from $z \approx 10 \text{ to } 1000$, because of the light absorption from neutral hydrogen (before Epoch of Re-ionisation)
- *The dark ages*


The cores of early proto-galaxies contained supermassive black holes (quasars)
- We don't know how these formed

### Simulating Evolution of the Universe

**General process:**
1. Compute gravitational interactions between all particles
2. Update positions
3. Expand universe
4. repeat



### Era of Galaxies
- $z \approx 8\text{ to }1$


### The Modern Universe
Solar system forms at $z \approx 0.6$
