## Universal Law of Gravitation
1. Every mass attracts every other mass
2. Attraction is *directly* proportional to the product of their masses
3. Attraction is *inversely* proportional to the *square* of their distances

$$F_g = G\frac{M_1M_2}{d^2}$$
**Universal constant of gravitation:** $G = 6.67\times10^{-11} \ m^3/(kg\times s^2)$


Kepler's laws apply to *all* orbiting objects, not just planets.
- Satellites
- Asteroids
- Molecules

Ellipses are not the only orbital paths. Laws of gravity allow for:
- Bound (ellipses)
- Unbound
	- Parabola
	- Hyperbola

#### Why do objects fall at the same rate?
- The gravitational acceleration of an object like a rock does not depend on its mass because the mass of the rock cancels with itself:
$$a_{rock} = \frac{F_g}{M_{rock}} \text{ cancels with } F_g = G\frac{M_{rock} \ M_{Earth}}{d^2}$$
$$a_{rock} = G\frac{M_{rock} \ M_{Earth}}{M_{rock} \times d^2}$$

### Center of Mass
As momentum is conserved, orbiting objects orbit around their centre of mass.

For the Sun and the Earth, the centre of mass is within the Sun - hence the Earth orbits entirely around the Sun.
For 2 objects of equal mass (e.g. black holes) they orbit each other equally.


### Kepler's Third Law
Newton's laws of gravity and motion showed that the relationship between the *orbital period* and *average orbital distance* of a system tells us its total mass.

[[L3 & L4 - Kepler's Laws and Orbital Motion]]

Combining the universal law of gravitation and Kepler's third law:
$$p^2 = \frac{4 \pi^2}{G(M_1 + M_2)}a^3$$
Where:
- $p$ = orbital period (years)
- $a$ = semi-major axis (AU)

So the constant in Kepler's third law can now be computed!

This allows us to 'weigh' distant orbital systems through observation of period.


### 2-Body Problem
The total orbital energy (gravitational + kinetic) stays constant if there is no external force.

**This means orbits cannot spontaneously change**, so in order to change an orbit, we need to add or remove kinetic energy from the system.
- Friction or atmospheric drag
- A gravitational encounter

>[!example]
>A comet approaching the solar system on an unbound (parabolic) orbit around the Sun may interact with another planet (e.g. Jupiter) in such a way that a majority of its kinetic energy is transferred into Jupiter, slowing it down enough to be captured in a bound orbit around the Sun.

There is no analytic solution to the 3 body problem!!

### Escape Velocity
If an object gains enough orbital energy, it may escape (bound => unbound)

Earth's escape velocity is roughly $11.2 \ km \ s^{-1}$

Escape velocity is constant regardless of the satellite's mass.

A suborbital trajectory (i.e. collision with Earth) is still an elliptical orbit, it's just that the focus is so close that it collides with Earth.


### Tides
The Moon's gravity pulls harder on the near side of Earth than on the far side.

This causes the Earth to *stretch* as a result of differential force:
![[Tidal Pull.png]]

As Earth spins on its axis, it pulls the tide along with it - so the tide is always slightly ahead of the Moon

The Sun also has an effect on the tide, hence the size of tides depend on the current phase of the Moon.

#### Tidal Friction
- Tidal friction gradually slows Earth's rotation.
- The Moon once rotated faster; tidal friction is why it orbits synchronously
