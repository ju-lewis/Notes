## How long is a day?

**24 hours** with respect to the Sun
Roughly **23 hours and 56 minutes** with respect to the background stars

This discrepancy comes from the rotation of the Earth around the Sun.
Every century the rotational period of Earth slows by about 2 milliseconds as a result of tidal forces.


Sometimes the rotation of the Earth speed up! - **Why is this?**
- Chandler Wobble?
- Melting of mountain icecaps and conservation of angular momentum?
- Magnetic fields?
We're not entirely sure.


## What does the Solar System look like?
There are 8 major planets with nearly circular orbits, all in the same direction

Five dwarf planets are smaller than the major planets
- Some of them have very elliptical orbits

The part of the solar system occupied by planets is quite flattened

*Terrestrial* planets are like Earth
- Rocky
- Small
- Close to the Sun
*Jovian* planets are like Jupiter
- Gaseous
- Larger
- Farther from the Sun

### Major features of the Sun and planets
**Sun**
- Over 99.9% of the solar system's mass
- Made mostly of H/He plasma
- Converts 4 million tons of mass into energy per second

**Mercury**
- Made of metal and rock
- Similar appearance to the Moon!
- Very hot (425 c) and very cold (-170 c)

**Venus**
- Nearly identical in size to Earth
- Surface hidden by thick clouds
- Extremely dense atmosphere (*Extreme greenhouse effect*)
- Much hotter than Mercury (~470 c)

**Earth**
- Only planet with liquid water
- Has a surprisingly large moon

**Mars**
- Looks almost Earth-like
- Giant volcanos, polar caps, massive canyon
- Water flowed in a distant past

**Jupiter**
- Much farther from the Sun than inner planets
- Mostly H/He
- Has a solid core - metallic hydrogen!!
- 300 times more massive than Earth
- 4 Galilean moons - Io, Europe, Callisto, Ganymede

**Saturn**
- Gas giant
- Largest moon is Titan
- Rings are not solid, they're made of countless small chunks of ice and rock
	- They behave like tiny moons
- Cassini flew 'through' the rings

**Uranus**
- Smaller than Jupiter/Saturn, still much larger than Earth
- Made of H/He *and* hydrogen compounds (water, ammonia, methane)
- Extreme axial tilt
- Moons and rings

**Neptune**
- Similar to Uranus (except for axial tilt)
- Many moons (including Triton)


### Swarms of Other Bodies:
**Rocky asteroids** - closer in
**Icy comets** - further out

The Kuiper belt is much further out, and composed of comets.

### Notable Exceptions:
- Venus has a retrograde rotation
- Earth has an abnormally large moon


### How do we know how big the Solar System is?

For **terrestrial planets** we can send a radio signal and measure the amount of time it takes to bounce back from its surface.

For gaseous planets, we can use the **transit of Venus**:
- Apparent position of Venus on Sun during transit depends on distances in solar system and your position on Earth
