An atmosphere is a layer of gas that surrounds a planet.

## Earth's Atmosphere
About 10km thick
Primarily nitrogen and oxygen gas

### Effects of Atmospheres:
- They create pressure (determines whether there is liquid water)
- Absorb and scatter light
- Creates wind, weather, climate
- Interacts with solar wind to create *magnetosphere*
- They can make planetary surfaces warmer (greenhouse effect)


## Planetary Temperature
Determined by the balance of:
- Energy from sunlight being absorbed
- Outgoing thermal radiation

Planetary temperature is related to reflectivity (*albedo*)

>[!note]
**Albedo** is the ratio between reflection and absorption of light

Low albedo -> Higher temperatures
High albedo -> lower temperatures


### Greenhouse Effect
As visible light passes through the atmosphere after reflecting from the surface, some of it will become 'trapped' by the atmospheric gases 

The diatomic molecules absorb infrared radiation, increasing temperature.


**Atmospheric properties significantly vary with altitude**
- Troposphere
	- Lowest layer
	- Warmed by IR from Earth's surface
- Stratosphere
	- Warmed by UV from the Sun
- Mesosphere
	- Warmed by X-Ray and UV from the Sun
- Thermosphere


Blue light scatters more due to its shorter wavelength.
Sunsets appear more red due to the greater distance the light has to travel through the atmosphere, leaving mainly light that has a lower tendency to scatter

Earth's magnetosphere is stretched by the Solar wind

### Weather and Climate
**Weather** is the daily variation in wind, clouds, temperatures, and pressure
**Climate** is the long-term average of weather; long-term stability of climate depends on global conditions

### 4 Factors Effecting the Atmosphere
1. Solar brightening
	1. Over billions of years the Sun will continue to become brighter
2. Changes in axis tilt
	1. Larger tilt => more extreme seasons
	2. Small gravitational 'tugs' from other bodies cause Earth's axis to vary between 22 and 25 degrees
3. Changes in reflectivity
4. Changes in greenhouse gases


### Obtaining an atmosphere
- Outgassing from volcanos
- Evaporation of surface liquid (or sublimation of surface ice)
- Impacts of particles and photons

### Losing an atmosphere
- Molecules have escape velocity
- Solar wind blows it away
- Condensation onto surface
- Chemical reactions with surface
- Large impacts blasting gas into space


In practice, light molecules have a higher velocity (compared to other molecules with the same kinetic energy) and are much more likely to escape.


## Mars
### Seasons on Mars
Mars has a highly eccentric orbit, making the seasons extreme (with the same axial tilt as Earth)

This can be seen by examining the composition of the poles:
- **South Pole**: water ice (remains all year round)
- **North Pole**: carbon dioxide ice (sublimates when near the Sun)

The evidence of past liquid water on Mars suggests Mars lost its atmosphere at some point

## Venus
Venus has a very thick carbon dioxide atmosphere => strong greenhouse effect
- 90 bar

Slow rotation results in a very weak Coriolis effect (no rotating weather cells)
- Very little weather

### Why is Venus so different to Earth?

**The runaway greenhouse effect**
The closer position to the Sun resulted in a surface temperature about 30 degrees higher.

This causes higher levels of water evaporation, creating a stronger greenhouse effect - further raising temperature.
