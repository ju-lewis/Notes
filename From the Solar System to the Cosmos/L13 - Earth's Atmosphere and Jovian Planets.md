Why is there so much oxygen? *Life.*
- Planet located in the habitable zone -> water
- Life -> *decrease* in CO2, *increase* in O2
- O2 -> ozone layer
- Earth's Moon -> stable orbit and spin


## Four Important Questions
- Why did Earth retain most of its outgassed water?
- Why does Earth have so little atmospheric CO2?
- Why does Earth's atmosphere consist mostly of nitrogen and oxygen
- Why does Earth have an ultraviolet-absorbing stratosphere


### Ozone and the Stratosphere
UV light can break up O2, allowing O3 to form.

Without plants to release O2, there would be no ozone to absorb UV.


### Comparative Planetology
By comparing the possible evolution and formation of the planets, we can understand the complex relationships in the major physical system on Earth


#### CO2 Concentration
Global temperatures have tracked CO2 concentration for the last 800,000 years

Current CO2 concentration is the highest it's been in at least 800,000 years


#### The 'Keeling' Curve
Carbon dioxide concentration (in ppm) over time

The 'sawtooth' along the curve is the seasonal growth of northern hemisphere trees.

#### Earth's "thermostat"
- Cooling allows CO2 to build up in the atmosphere
- Heating causes rain to reduce CO2 in atmosphere

#### Long-Term Climate Change
- Changes in Earth's axis tilt might lead to ice ages
- Widespread ice increases albedo -> lowers temperatures further
- Oceans outgas CO2 when cold -> temperatures raising again


**Indicators of Global Warming**
- Increase in Humidity 
- Increase in sea surface temperature
- Increase in sea level
- Decrease in glaciers
- Decrease in snow cover



## Jovian Planets

### Basic Facts
- Have a fast rotation (10-17 hours)
- Low density
- Similar composition to the Sun


### Formation
- Gases get blown to outer solar system
- Small ice planetesimals form
- Planetesimals collide to form planets
- Larger planets attract gases


All jovian planets have extensive moon and ring systems
(Currently there are 285 jovian moons known)


**Moons can be classified into 2 groups**
1. Formed in an accretion disk (Larger, regular orbits, lots of ice)
2. Captured (smaller, irregular shapes/orbits, little geological activity)


### Jupiter
Jupiter has similar atmospheric structure, but very different internal structure to Earth.

Jupiter has a significant magnetosphere due to the presence of metallic Hydrogen (same as Saturn)

Jupiter's Galilean moons are in orbital resonance - causing the orbits to become elliptical. (They 'tug' on each other at the same point due to their periods being multiples)
