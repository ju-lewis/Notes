## Some properties of the Solar System
1. Patterns of motion and of the large bodies
2. Existence of 2 types of planets (terrestrial and jovian)
3. Existence of smaller bodies (asteroids and comets)
4. Notable exceptions to usual patterns (rotation of Uranus, Earth's Moon, Venus' rotation)



## Formation

### Nebular Theory
- States that our solar system formed from gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar gas cloud (*solar nebula*)
- Kant and Laplace proposed it over 2 centuries ago
- Large amount of supporting evidence



### Galactic Recycling
1. Stars are born in clouds of gas and dust
2. Starts produce heavier elements from lighter ones
3. Starts return material to space when they die

The elements that formed planets were made in stars and then recycled through interstellar space.

## Explaining the Properties
### 1. What causes the orderly patterns of motion?

**Conservation of Angular Momentum**
The rotation speed of the cloud from which our Solar System formed must have increased as the cloud contracted under gravity.

As a 3-dimensional cloud collapses, it will collapse on its shortest axis first, hence the observed flattening, this is further accelerated by particle collisions within the disk.

The *conservation of energy* results in the cloud heating up.

The planets form from the warm dense dust cloud orbiting the star after it's born.

### 2. Why are there 2 major types of planets?

The inner parts of the disk are far hotter than outer parts
Rocks can be solid at much greater temps than ice

Near the Sun, ices melt and evaporate - they either:
1. Get blown away by the Sun's *solar wind*
2. Get accreted onto a planet or large mass

So we're left with solid rocks and metals in the inner Solar System, and ices further out.

Ices can exist beyond the *frost line* of a solar system.

#### How did the terrestrial planets form?
Planetesimals of rock and metal built up as they collided.
Over time these collisions and gravitational attraction built the planetesimals into bigger terrestrial planets.

*However*, recent simulations suggest that 'pebble accretion' was more efficient than planetesimal accretion! In essence, smaller masses can be built from planetesimal accretion, but it cannot fully compose a larger mass like Earth, The Moon, or Venus.

#### How did the jovian planets form?
Ice could form small particles outside the frost line, and larger planetesimals and planets were able to form.

The gravity of the planets began to draw in surrounding H and He gases through *accretion*


#### Is formation of a planetary system inevitable?

Currently (08/08/2024) *5741* exoplanets have been found.
Many of the planets have periods $\leq 100$ days because of limited observation times.
