## Composition of the Solar System
- H/He Gas **(98%)** Doesn't condense
- Hydrogen compounds **(1.4%)** Condenses at <150 K
- Rock **(0.4%)** Condenses below 500-1300 K
- Metal **(0.2%)** Condenses below 1000-1600 K


### Forming the jovian planets
Each jovian planet is a 'miniature solar system'
- Forming moons in the same way that the Sun forms planets


- Formed outside the 'frost line' where volatiles form solids
- Photons and solar wind blew away the gases to outside the frost line

### Solar Rotation
The young Sun rotated much faster than it does today (nebular theory)
Friction between solar magnetic field and solar wind slowed the rotation over time




## More properties of the Solar System

### 3. What are asteroids and comets?

**Asteroids**:
- Non-spherical (too small to be crushed under gravity)
- Pock-marked from small impacts

**Comets**:
- Have a nucleus (~1km) and 2 tails
	- Dust tail (illuminated by the Sun), Ion tail

Asteroids and comets are leftover junk from the planetary accretion process.
- Inside the frost line there was rocky debris
- Outside the frost line there was icy debris

Immediately after the planetary formation period, the leftover planetesimals bombarded other objects.

#### Origin's of Earth's Water
Earth is inside the frost line, so it is unlikely to have come from the planetary formation period, *but we do not exactly know where it's from.*

- Water may have come to Earth as icy planetesimals or even Theia (likely ~10%)
- Some sampled comets have the wrong isotopic ratios to match Earths, but some do match

It is more likely that chemical reactions in the Earth's crust released water that was trapped when Earth was formed.

The most recent theory is that Earth formed its own water due to the high partial pressure and temperature of hydrogen in the atmosphere.


### 4. Why are there exceptions to the patterns?

**Captured Moons**:
Instead of moons being created through planetesimal accretion around the planet, moons can be captured (Phobos, Deimos)

#### Why is Earth's moon so big?
Earth's moon is vary large and quite similar to Earth in some ways (too similar to be a random body!)

A Mars-like object (*Theia*) collided with Earth, and the debris sent into orbit regrouped under gravitational attraction to form the Moon


**Giant impacts** are also likely to be the reason for Venus' backwards rotation and Uranus' odd tilt



## Do all stars have planets?
Formation of the planets in the solar nebula seems inevitable.

Stars likely always form from the collapse of solar nebula, and thus there is probably always leftover material to accrete into planets.


### How old is the Solar System?
A method we can use to date the Solar System is by finding the oldest rocks

If we find a rock that is intact and contains uranium-238, we can look for the presence of its decay products and their relative amounts to see how long has passed.

**Basic Idea of Radiometric Dating**
- All elements in a 'rock' formed at the same time
- No new 'parent' or 'daughter' formed at later times
- Half-life is known
- Process: count the numbers of parent and daughter atoms
- U-Pb ratios
