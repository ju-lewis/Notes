# What is Learning

**Why do we learn?**:
Learning is fitting a function to data, which allows a mapping from every possible input to an output:
- $\hat y = f(x)$

Examples:
- Learning multiplication
- Learning how to ride a bike (very high dimensional example)

# Why Generalise?

**When don't you need to learn?**:
- If the input set is clearly defined and finite
	- You can memorise all of the input -> output mappings
- If there is no rule that could relate input to output, the only solution is to memorise
- Does memorisation work for real-world problems?
	- Generally no, because the input is continuous
