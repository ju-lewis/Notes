# Contract Law
In its simplest form a contract is a *legally binding agreement*
- Define the legal relationship between two parties
- Involve an exchange
- Cornerstone of business

Never overlook the importance of the work "relationship" in "legal relationship"

Has a legally **enforceable contract** been formed?
- What are the terms?
- Have the terms been fulfilled?
- What are the consequences of a breach of contract?

## Negotiating Contracts

In reality there is no such thing as a "standard" contract
- There are a number of variables and these will depend on the *relative bargaining position* of the parties

Bargaining position will be determined by competition
- Is there a lot of competition to provide services to the party wanting them because they believe that providing those services will be profitable?
- Or are there few service providers so that party is forced to accept less favourable terms or forego those services?

## Lawyers

A lawyers position will be determined by his or her client's bargaining position - and the client's level of rationality in approaching the negotiation
