A performer can approach a venue
- Often a third party (a *promoter*) will engage the artist to perform and the venue to host the show, paying the cost of staging and marketing the show as well as selling the tickets.
- Having a promoter involved shifts financial risk partially away from the artist and venue

Venues very rarely directly pay artists to perform, rather they act as hireable entities for promoters.
