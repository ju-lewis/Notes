We consider the economic models of the recording and publishing industries


# Publishing
The basis of the music publishing industry is "service"

The music publisher effectively offers three types of services:
- Maximising the revenue generated by the exploitation of songs
- Collecting the revenue due to the songwriter from that exploitation
- Protecting the copyright in the songs of the songwriters the publisher represents


In return for the provision of these services the publisher is paid by the songwriter


## Economics of Publishing

This payment rarely takes the form of a fee - rather it's a split of the income generated and collected
- The "commission" is actually structured as a "royalty" payable to the songwriter
- The royalty is generally in favour of the songwriter and can vary dependent of the type of income that has been generated


These arrangements can be further modified by the notion of competition
- If publishers drive revenue from exploitation of copyright in songs, publishers want the "best possible" songs forming their catalogue
- Not all publishers are the same and they don't all provide identical services


Publishers often compete on things like better collection mechanisms, or more robust copyright defences
- Possibly also competing through offering an *advance*


The other element of the publisher's business is the acquisition of copyright
- This asset valuation that represents a large proportion of the value of a publishing company in the event of a takeover or trade sale
- In the recent times this element of publishing has been recognised by hedge funds and investment banks

>[!Summary]
>Music publishing is the business that exists and reolves around the ownership and explotation of the legal rights provided by **copyright in songs or musical compositions**
>
>Therefore it is an industry that derives its assets from the creative work of songwriters or composers - not from recording artists


# Recording

The recording industry exploits the **copyright in sound recordings**
- Of course the Copyright Act provides that the owner of copyright in a sound recording is entitled 

The creation of sound recordings could be funded by the record company or the sound recordings could be acquired from someone else (usually an artist) who may have already created the recording

Either way, the creation or acquisition of the sound recording is an expense of the recorded music industry
- It costs a record company something to acquire the right to exploit that sound recording and simple logic dictates that the business would prefer that cost to be less rather than more

## Artist-Company Relationship

To the record company, the artist is an expense
- Any money or costs paid to (or on behalf of) the artist is an expense in the process of creating the products that the record company intends to sell


Accordingly the negotiation of a record contract is simply an attempt to resolve a basic conflict - the record company wants to acquire as much as possible at the lowest cost, while the artist wants to give up as little as possible for the highest cost
- A deal is signed when a mutually acceptable compromise then a deal is signed


## Economics of Scarcity

It used to be that making sound recordings was very expensive
- Based in the tech required

When the cost of recording was high, it meant third parties were required
- Record labels

When the costs of various inputs are reduced, then more and more suppliers are able to supply recorded music - and so we enter the "economics of abundance"
- This led to the phenomenon of "The Long Tail"

## Licensing Revenue
When a record company licenses a sound recording for use in media (e.g. synchronisation), there is no marginal cost due to manufacturing and distributing
- As a result, these revenue streams are very important for overall profit of record labels

It's important to note that sound recordings are "non-perishable" goods
- Can be continued to be sold indefinitely
- Hence a recording can continue to be sold for decades without any additional recording costs
	- And in the case of digital sales there is no marginal costs of packaging or distribution either
