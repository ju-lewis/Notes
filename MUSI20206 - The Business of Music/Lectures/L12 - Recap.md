The business of music is about connecting the creators of music to the consumers

**From a business perspective**:
- Investment in the creation of new music vs. the exploitation of existing records

Music has "gone from a business about ownership to a business about access"
- Music is a service industry - it's about businesses doing what the artist doesn't want to do, doesn't have the time to do, doesn't know hot to do, or doesn't realise they need to do

Bargaining power is incredibly important
- There are no real rules/pre-requisites - everything is based in bargaining and providing services to people who don't necessarily know what services they need
