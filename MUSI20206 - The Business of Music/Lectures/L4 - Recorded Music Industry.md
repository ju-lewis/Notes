Important aspects:
- Recording
- Reproduction
- Marketing
- Distribution

## Then vs. Now
**Recording**:
- Recording is far cheaper now (potentially even free)
**Reproduction
- Reproduction used to require extensive factories (records, cassettes, CD production)
	- There was also extensive wastage of imperfect stock
- Manufacturing is no longer required
	- Infinite numbers of reproductions can be made with no marginal cost
**Advertising/Marketing**
- Marketing was largely limited to paid advertisement
	- Promotional staff were needed
	- Reach was limited by territorial limitations
- Now there are multitudes of different means of advertising
	- Mostly free or comparatively low cost
**Distribution**
- Now an infinite number of digital copies can be infinitely distributed simultaneously
	- No wasted stock on shelves or in warehouses
	- There are no layers of middlemen needing to be paid

## Impacts of the Evolution
Now anyone can participate in the business of recorded music
- It as meant that niche products that would otherwise not have been available on the world market are now easily accessible

This has led to the suggestion of the concept called *The Long Tail*

### The Long Tail
Chris Anderson first identified the idea of the Long Tail
- Describes how diminishing storage and distribution costs create a business environment where it is profitable to sell a very small number of specialised products to a wide range of people with diversified taste preferences
- The *head* is what's popular, but the long tail theory suggests that this is artificial and is a product of poor supply offerings caused by high costs of distribution
