## Retail Sales Income

Record sales generate income for a number of participants in the recorded music industry
- Retailers
- Distributors
- Record label
- Artists
- Manufacturer
- Music Publishers
- Songwriter

## Licensing Income

Income generated when a recording is used by a third party - requiring the permission of the rights owner.
- Record label
- Artists
- Music Publisher
- Songwriter

## Retail v Licensing
- Licensing income is a more attractive financial model than retail sales
- Licensing works best for songs that are popular or successful
	- You still need to effectively establish "hit songs".


## Streaming & Licensing
- Streaming is simply another form of licensing
- It is based on the rights owner of the recording giving away permission for someone to use the recording for a specific purpose
- But instead of paying a large fee for that permission as the producer of an advert or film would do, the streaming platform pays an extremely low fee for that use

The obvious result is that the only rights holders that are able to generate large and sustainable revenues are those who control massive amounts of rights

Downloads are just another form of sale (which are typically preferable to physical sales)

# Future of Streaming

Goldman Sachs predicted *1.2 billion people* will be paying for streaming by 2030

Spotify had 602 million monthly active users in the final quarter of 2023

## Music Business Companies Pivot

Many distributors started to offer digital distribution services

Another business model arose - effectively a business with its roots in the technology industry rather than the music industry - the business of digital aggregation

A number of key parameters has remained the same:
- Copyright still supported both songs and sound recordings
- Artists were still basing their model in sale
- Labels and publishers still valued third party licensing fees
- Artists (and their managers) began placing importance on other revenue streams
