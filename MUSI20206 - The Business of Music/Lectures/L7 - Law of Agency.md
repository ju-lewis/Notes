The very nature of entertainment suggests that the artists/performers/entertainers are generally skilled at creating the art, but the process of selling those works isn't necessarily their strong area!

**Agents v Managers**
The law of agency doesn't just cover agents as we know the term - it also covers managers who are the artist's representative

It's important to establish the extent to which the agent can bind the principal
- Duty to follow the principals instructions
- Duty to act in person
- Duty to act in good faith
- Duty to make full disclosure of any personal interest
- Duty not to make a secret profit
- Duty to exercise reasonable care and skill

## Management

Essentially the role of the manager is to be a coordinator for all the other service providers in the artist's career

### Management Business Structure
Traditionally we have always thought of the manager as a lone wolf who has a direct relationship with the artist

Increasingly though, managers are operating within larger organisations
- This is perhaps indicative of an increasing move towards corporatisation or professionalism across the business of artist management

### Contractual Elements
**Exclusivity**:
- The artist will normally be exclusive to the Manager
- Normally the manager will not be exclusive to the artist

**Territory**:
- The manager will want the broadest possible territory - in order to generate a return from their efforts
- But an artist will obviously want to obtain the best representation they can
- The manager may not have contacts, knowledge, etc outside of their home territory

**Duration**:
- The manager wants a long term (to make money back, particularly from the early period) 
- The artists usually wants short terms for flexibility

**Payment**:
- Typically a commission between 15 and 20%
- Commission could be either net or gross
- Retainer or fixed fee is possible depending on the nature of provided services
