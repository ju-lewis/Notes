# Marketing of Music

Music marketing is an area that confuses many people because there isn't a single common destination that all music marketers are seeking to reach

In many ways it was a simpler process once - the goal was to achieve a sale, this is no longer true
- Remember, consumption is the new sales

## Consumers of Music

Is someone who streams your song on Spotify a consumer of your music?
- They don't have a transaction directly with you
Is someone who buys merch with your logo on it a consumer of music?
Is someone who hears your song in a mall a consumer of your music?


It's arguable that each of those people/businesses are "consumers of music" and yet it should be obvious that the marketing strategies and techniques involved in generating each of those transactions are very different.

Hence a threshold question with any marketing activation is "what is the transaction that we are working towards and how does this activity assist in moving towards that transaction?"


## Scope of Music Marketing
There are very few industries where there are so many options available under the heading of "marketing"
- There are a huge number of buzz phrases littering the landscape

## Formally Defining Marketing

>[!Note] Definition
>The management process through which goods and services move from concept to the customer.

It includes the coordination of four elements called the 4 P's of marketing:
1. Identification, selection, and development of a product
2. Determination of its price
3. Selection of a distribution channel to reach the customer's place
4. Development and implementation of a promotional strategy
(Product, price, place, promotion)

Increasingly the music industry has embraced the culture of marketing as a necessity
- Understanding where marketing fits in to the music landscape is essential to being a part of the process

Michael Coppel puts the marketing of music into perspective:
- We have a much more competitive market. If you go back 15 or 20 years, people's entertainment budgets weren't so committed.

Scot Crawford:
- I believe the core of what we do is marketing and promotion. I think that the future of entertainment, whether it is music or visual arts, is based around marketing and promotion.

# Brands

A brand is a product or services with a distinct personality. A distinctive personality is what enables people to differentiate one brand from another

Strong brands elicit opinions, emotions, and sometimes physiological responses from customers

There's three elements to "brand":
- A brand has a personality and a story leading to an emotional connection

The music and the music business are perfectly suited to the idea of a brand as a story and a story making an emotional connection with the audience - turning them into fanatics

A good example of this in the music industry are artists like Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift who create strong connections with their audiences

Now, the question that has to be asked first is - what are we trying to sell?

## IMC - Integrated Marketing Communications
There are a number of elements in the marketing strategy and no one element of the promotional mix (advertising, publicity, public relations, sales-promotion, direct marketing, sales) is executed without impacting the others

# Viewpoint on Music Marketing

Mark Meharry:
- Managers are realising that you don't create hype around your band so you can broker deals with companies - that doesn't work anymore. Brands have direct access to consumers and can sell directly to them
- (Gatekeepers are dead)

In reality, both experts are correct
- Artist marketing needs to consider all angles in an attempt to work out what is going to give them the crack in the door
