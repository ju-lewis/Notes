# Introduction

People typically think of music as "the track"
- A single entity created by "the artist"
There's a natural assumption that the artist somehow "owns" the track and is making money from it

It's uncommon for the reality of the legal, structural, or institutional processes that underpins the business of music

**The Track**
- Composed of two parts:
	- The song - the work of the songwriter/artist
	- The recording - the work of whoever it was that made the recording

Usually "the recording" is a recording of "the song" (lol)
- The person who made the recording is *not always the same person*
- This is where the business/legal aspects become more nuanced
	- It's important to establish who owns each
	- What is important is who owns "the rights" to those two separate (but sometimes connected) assets


# Copyright in the Recorded Music Industry
Copyright is a form of intellectual property, and as such, is the subject of a large body of law
- It incentivises people to invest their time, talent, and other resources into developing new material


Copyright only protects specific things or "subject-matters"
- Literary works
- Dramatic works
- Films
- *Musical works*
- *Sounds recordings*
- Broadcasts
- Published editions

The owner of copyright in a song has an exclusive right to reproduce a song or to perform/communicate the song publicly
- It follows that they then have the right to negotiate terms and conditions upon which they will grant that permission and those terms and conditions may include a payment in some form
- That business is the *music publishing business*

Most of the clauses in recording contracts and publishing contracts are about who owns the copyright, what they are allowed to do with it, and what does the creator of the work receive
- Most of the disputes in these industries - especially relating to payments in the digital era - are firmly based in the law of copyright


## Mechanical Royalty

Every time a CD or any device containing music is manufactured and sold, it generates a *mechanical royalty*

Logically there is a separate copyright in the song to the copyright in the sound recording or in the performance, and where there is a separate copyright, there is a separate royalty payable
- This separate royalty is known as a mechanical royalty

The rate of mechanical royalty is set by statue and is payable to the songwriter
- The rate varies between countries
- The rate does not change when the artist and songwriter are the same person
	- Strictly, if an artist records and releases the album independently they are required to pay themselves a mechanical royalty

>[!Info] Summary
>Paid when the song is reproduced (by the reproducer to the copyright holder)


## Performance Royalties
Performance royalties are collected by a Performing Rights Organisation (PRO)
- In Australia this is APRA

Unlike mechanical royalties, there is no simple formula to calculate the amount of public performance and broadcast royalty payable

PROs issue "*blanket licenses*" to some users of music
- The users don't need to log the exact songs that they play (e.g. a cafe using spotify over the speakers)
- Other users, such as radio and TV stations are required to log an exact list of what music they play

>[!Info] Summary
>Paid as a generic subscription-based license, distributed by the PRO

## Synchronisation
The permission that is needed to synchronise a song to a visual image is called a synchronisation license (or a sync license for short).

>[!Info] Summary
>Negotiated individually when someone wants to use the song in other media
