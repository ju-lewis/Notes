# Barriers to Entry
- Massive increase in the amount of recorded music provided and the number of providers of that music
- Many individuals and businesses are able to participate in activities in the recorded music industry

App in Sweden separates the vocal stem from the track and allows you to create a new track for the vocals
- Done with the permission of the recording owner
- Any creations/derivative works become *co-owned* by the 'remixer' and the original copyright holder

It was this reduction of barriers of entry that leads to *the Long Tail* phenomenon
- Huge volume of niche music forms more of the recorded music industry than highly successful popular music

## 1000 True Fans
Essay written by Kevin Kelly predicting that the internet would allow large swaths of people to make a living off their creations, whether an artist, musician, author, or entrepreneur
- The idea was adopted by many of commentators in the creative industries
- Example: think about having 5 fans in all ~200 countries in the world
	- Monetisation in this scenario would have been impossible before (in a world of physical distribution)
- The concept of needing 1000 true (monetised) fans as a source of income was the basis of the idea of crowd-funding

# Storage
The impact of digital has been significant in the area of storage as well
- Itunes first launched in 2003 with 200,000 songs (as a result of a deal with 5 major labels)
- These days a music service with less than 60 million songs is considered inadequate

>[!Note]
Footscray records purchased the vinyl collection of Pentridge Prison
>- Music from prisoners made as part of a rehab program :D

Charles Caldas of Merlin:
- Everything is in stock all the time


## Ownership vs. Access
Consumers began questioning the value of "owning music" in the age of digital files
- e.g. Owning vinyls vs. owning mp3 file

Consumers began wanting to pay for *access*
- This is how streaming began (the industry had to take 1 step back to the older format of streaming!)
	- It became better when broadband internet became more popular (increasing download speed)


### Streaming
As the value of the streaming market grows, people are starting to realise that consumption is the new sales Anywhere that people are listening to music is actually the end-game now.


Allen Bergfrede is a leading music industry academic
- Quote from 2016:
- Streaming is growing exponentially and the up-take has been really, really fast over the past few years. I think we are still five ears off from a critical mass in streaming


## Super Fans
Anna Nicolaou:
- Increasingly, the chatter among music executives is about "monteising superfans"
