Digital Criminology refers to the rapidly developing field of scholarship that applies criminological, social, and cultural technical theory to the study of crime, deviance, and justice in a digital society - Stratton et al., 2017:27 

### Cyber-enabled Crimes (old wine in new bottle theory):
Technology provides an already existing crime with a new medium
### Cyber-dependent Crime:
Crimes only possible through technology and the internet

#### We'll be focusing on the idea that digital crime is entirely separate to previous forms of crime.


## Approaches to Cybercrime

| ***Approach*** | ***Principles***                                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Zemiology      | - Focuses on the experience of being harmed through cybercrime<br>- Expands definition of harm beyond the body (see Canning & Tombs, 2021) |
| Carceral       | - Adopts a traditional policing approach to cybercrimes<br>- Limited by issues of jurisdiction                                             |
| Informal       | - Centers victim-survivor needs in online settings, exploring new possibilities for justice outside of the law                             |

### What is wrong with a CJS response to cybercrime?
There is an assumption that the virtual world is entirely distinct from the real world.

There is no recognition that the world may have changed, including the distinction between real and virtual, and that crime has changed with it.

### Cultural Criminology - Critiquing Routine Action Theory
The CJS is prone to making certain assumptions, because it is unconsciously attached to rational choice theories, in which they response to crime as a fact rather than *creating* it.

**Assumptions of the CJS**:
1. People are assholes - all of us have this '*a*' factor, the potential to become criminals.
	- We are rational, if the state makes crime attractive (high gains, low risks) many will commit crimes
	- To reduce crime, simply make risks high and gains low
	- *Rational Choice Theory*

**Jack Katz on the 'existentialism' Cultural Criminology**
- An open existential ethnography of groups deemed criminal means looking at their worlds
	- **Ethnography:** *the scientific description of peoples and cultures with their customs, habits, and mutual differences.*
- "Modern casual theories have obliterated a natural fascination to follow in detail the lived contours of crime."

With Cultural Criminology, we're coming to terms with *what* people are getting out of various forms of cyber-crime, from the perspective of the groups themselves

***Crime is fun, crime is thrilling, crime makes you feel powerful***
Rational choice theory can be absolutely wrong, if you do an ethnography of cybercriminals.

### Considering crime as a mere means to an end is erroneous in many cases.

A hacker may be attracted to the challenge posed by increased security - putting up digital fences and streetlights increases the thrill.


## Example:
**Scenario: additional security cameras are placed inside a supermarket to deter kids from committing petty theft**

| Means-End Theory / Rational Choice Theory                                                                                                                                                                                       | Cultural Criminology                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A child who otherwise would have stolen something small is now deterred by the increased security.<br><br>The risk has become higher, without any increase in payoff - hence the end no longer sufficiently justifies the means | A child sees the challenge and decides that he wants to steal anyway - both for the thrill and 'bragging rights' from pulling it off.<br><br>The risk has increased, but so has the thrill.<br><br>THE CRIME IS THE ENDS |


### Old vs New Materialism
- Criminology cannot fully comprehend new forms of crime if it remains in the realm of the old materialism
- **Old Materialism**
	- This can be *deterministic*: A gun makes one more violent than one was before ownership. Having a means creates a need.
		- CJS Response: Any misuse/abuse that is made *possible* by technology is made *likely* by technology. All rollouts of technology must be accompanied by safeguards
	- *Neutral*: A gun is a tool. The wielder cannot be changed by it. The gun itself cannot induce the wielder to act.
		- CJS Response: The choice to abuse technology is individual. Abusers must be severely punished for their bad choices.

Old materialism can be Vulgar or Neutral
- Vulgar + Neutral
	- Things are things and people are people
	- Tools are designed to help us do good things. Misuse is the fault of the wielder (i.e. plagiarism with ChatGPT)
- Vulgar + Reification + Neutral
	- No tools leans towards good or bad use.
	- Reification is the act of changing something abstract (existing as a though or idea) into something real
	- E.g. Social media is bad purely as a result of the conditions posed by capitalist influence on ownership. As a result of these influences, we *imagine* that it won't work unless it also mines our data, this is a lie.
- Vulgar + Determinist
	- Software designed to mine our data and make us doomscroll can only mine our data and make us unhappy
	- Fundamentally flawed software is *incapable* of making us happy
	- We need to design a platform that has user connection and joy as the model.
- Interesting:
	- People are people, but things are people too
	- Marx discussed "the conversion of things into persons and then conversions of persons into things" (1982, 209); and "progress resulting in endowing material forces with intellectual life"
	- Capitalism is about things becoming alive, and people becoming undead. In the work process, life is sucked out of people and absorbed by things
	- Things are valuable because they 'contain your life force'

**So what is the difference between *Interesting Materialism* and *New Materialism*?**
Human exceptionalism.
Interesting materialists posit that things can steal and imitate life, but never become alive. 

- **New Materialism**
	- The assertion that nonhumans are the missing masses of the social sciences (Latour, 1992)
	- New materialist principles make the neutral interpretation of old materialism problematic, now a gun absolutely can make one more violent than they were before ownership.
		- In this situation, the maker of the gun is liable, having created an object that turns people into killers
		- The object has created a need within the owner
		- ***But what if the object can generate a need that has nothing to do with the intentions of the 'producer' of the object?***
			- Is the object liable? Is the agent liable?
			- This links back to the internet/algorithms - is the internet capable of having agency? Can you be pulled into the network, having it induce needs within you?


# Week 2

## First, Second, and third-order technologies
**First Order:**
- The technology is in-between 

**Second Order:**

**Third Order:**
- The 'Technology-as-user'
- The technology is in between one technology and another
- Examples: Information and communication technology, AGI

## Actor Network Theory
**Botnets as hybrid criminal actor-networks** (Van der Wagen and Pieter (2015: 593))

### The criminology of Hybrids
Draw's on Bruno Latour's (1993) notion of technosocial hybrids to examine networks of crime and control

Brown (2006) argues that criminologists often preserve hierarchical binary divisions between *nature and culture* and *beings and things*.

- Hybrid victims
- Hybrid criminals

# Week 3

## Algorithms, Race, and Power

### Critical Race Theory
- *Classical* gender theory begins with the assumption that 'Man is not the human', one is a man because he is political, artistic, etc. One becomes a 'man' by living a certain kind of life. Women, children, and slaves are not 'man'. They have animal life.
- This is similar to *classical* race theory - based on the assumption that 'darker people are dark of mind'.

**Critical race theory, in short, means a rejection of the idea that the world is healed when everybody is the same.**

- Equality is now a white weapon. It is said: Women and non-whites have won their war, those who are behind 
- Afrofuturism
- Autonomist Marxism

### Neutrality is not the answer

- The internet is not neutral

#### The Brock Thesis:
- White users will register data that looks *subjectively* 'normal' as being neutral. They will fail to register that 'normal' is largely white.

- *Reification*: Any technology can be emancipatory or repressive, depending on the intentions of the user.


### Conclusions from determinism
### Conclusions from a technological neutrality standpoint

- Hardt and Negri lean into the concept of fully embracing technology for the purpose of emancipation
- Canella warns that if technology is neutral, then it can be used against you by the state as you use it against the state. As you use technology, the state is potentially reading and watching, and putting you on a monitoring list.

#### Actor Network Theory:
If the internet is racist, the state-police-internet-smartphone hybrid may have a distinct advantage

Various Australian states have enacted *anti-consorting* laws.
- The ostensible purpose is to outlaw criminal gangs.

Technology can change users by creating technicity harms, i.e., needs and desires that can be said to come from a thing that is agentic, or at least more than a thing.

#### Summary
- Classical and critical race theory
- The 'hidden' whiteness of the internet
- Various responses: fighting bias with bias, decolonising the internet
- Indeterminate conclusion. Both approaches have merit and problems.
# Week 4

Brown's Technosocial:
- We have never been modern ...
- This means: the distinctions between people, things, and animals have always been false. The Enlightenment is *more* mythological than prior cultures. It sees firm distinctions where it should see hybridity
- Most relevant myths:
	- Only human beings have agency
	- Human beings use tools
	- A virtual world is just a new tool for humans to use.
	- Even an agentic thing (AI) is just another tool.
- Agency can exist in things and networks
- Tools and users can become units

As a result of this technological hybridity, questions of criminal liability become difficult. However, 'keeping it simple' perhaps becomes unjust.

## Metaverse:
3 Narratives:

Libertarian:
- Case study: *autonomy* in drug use and markets
Neoliberal:
- Keep out the law and let people look after themselves
Revanche criminology and law approaches:
- The virtual world needs to be 'cleaned up'
- The same law and order that keeps criminals in check IRL needs to be moved into virtual space
- Argument for RICO type laws.

## Cryptomarkets:
- Anonymizing Software - Onion Router, or TOR
- Cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero

Vendors: Why do they do it?
- *Social Learning?* Vendors often entered the trade when a friend introduced them to it.
- *Strain?* Several vendors began selling to pay for student loans
- *Seductions of crime?* (Katz, 1987) 

Cryptomarkets and harm reduction:
*Safer Scoring?*
Cryptomarket vendors need a different skill-set to traditional drug dealers
Only 3% of cryptomarket buyers reported threats to their personal safety, compared to 14.2% who purchased from friends

*A Case for Decriminalisation?*


## Drug Policy Models:
**Zero-tolerance Model:**
- Deterrence-based
- 'War on drugs'
- Reducing the demand for drugs
**Harm reduction model:**
- Public health approach
- Reducing the harms associated with drug use
**Decriminalisation:**
- The Portugal Model
- Decriminalisation $\ne$  legalisation


### Albridge, Steven & Barratt
- Will growth in cryptomarket drug buying increase the harms of illicit drugs? (Albridge et al., 2018)
- "Most policy responses \[to drug cryptomarkets\] are based generally on the assumption that their rise will only increase drug harms". Aldridge et al. (2018: 789)

Cryptomarkets might reduce the harms associated with the drug trade though:
- Leading to *increases in the quality of drugs* purchased by users
- Decreasing the risks associated with purchasing drugs in person

As Buxton and Bingam (2015: 2) argue, "official responses \[to drug cryptomarkets\] should give primary to understanding how 'ethical' hidden drug markets that are regulated by their user communities and market forces might reduce the harms and violence of the 'tradition' drug trade and networks" 

***Are cryptomarkets a more ethical infrastructure for purchasing drugs?***

Some libertarian theses support 'organic' appearances of harm reduction approaches to drugs, potentially more ethics, potentially more safety.

State responses: Shut it down! Refusal to see any difference between online and offline drug selling.

### Crypto Scams
**Giveaway scams:**
**Pump and dump:**
**Cry for help scams:**

**Market exit scams:**

## Conclusion
- If we're entering the metaverse, there are conflicting views
1. Making the virtual world unregulated makes it a more free space, which will: a) work better/be fair/safe or b) be dangerous as hell, but still better because it's 'free'
2. Lack of regulation creates nothing but a criminal playground
- If we are merging with this world this question matters.

## Desistance and Surveillance

Two Tiers of Informal Justice:
- The state does not value the victim / The state does not see the perpetrator as 'really' harmful
- Punishment is not what the survivor wants

The first case requires activism.
In the second case, the CJS can let down the survivor twice. It generally only offers punishment (harm for harm).

If one desires a non-punitive solution, one must seek it informally



The state sees technology in four main ways:
- As a threat (The state needs technological sophistication to keep up with TFC)
- As a means of stopping crime
- As a means of enhancing approaches to catching, processing, and punishing offenders
- As a means of correcting its own problems
