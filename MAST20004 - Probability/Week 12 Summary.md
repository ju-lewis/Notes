## Computing Markov Transition Probabilities

We can model the applications of the discrete-time transformations raising the transition matrix to subsequent powers:

## Equilibrium Distributions

**Definitions**
Limiting definition
	$\lim_{n \to \infty}{\vec \pi_0 P^n} = \vec \pi$
Stationary definition
	$\vec \pi = \vec \pi P$
Ergodic definition
	On average, sequential trials of the equilibrium distribution will "spend time" in each state proportional to their equilibrium state probability
