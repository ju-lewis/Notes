*Terms* are built from variables and functions:
$$t ::= x \ | \ c \ | \ f(t,...,t)$$

*Formulas* are built from predicate symbols, terms, connectives and quantifiers:
$$\varphi ::= P \ | \ P(t,...,t) | \ \bot \ | \ \top \ | \ (\lnot \varphi) \ | \ (\varphi \lor \varphi) \ | \ (\varphi \lor \varphi) \ | \ (\varphi \to \varphi) \ | \ (\forall \ x \ \varphi) \ | \ (\exists \ x \ \varphi)$$
