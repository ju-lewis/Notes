# Materialism

**Different schools of though around how we should regard the relationship between humans and the world around them**

## Old
- Believe that only humans have agency, and that 'things' are completely passive. So only humans can act on, use, and change the nature of 'things'
## New
- Believe that 'things' can have agency too, because 'things' can also act on humans and change their nature.

It helps us see a more complete picture of digital dynamics:
- Rather than only analysing the 'user'


**Technology can change or amplify how preexisting/physical crimes/harms are committed**

# Online/Offline Harms and Victimhood

## Floridi and 'onlife'
Floridi argues that the development and widespread use of ICTs have radically changed the way we live.

Many digital criminologists ague that the distinction between online/offline is also fading in importance for harms/crimes, as they usually involve 'onlineness' in some way.

We often think of the *instant* in which harm is committed, however...

Consider whether any of these elements involve 'onlineness':
- The lead-up to that crime/harm
- Motivation/utilities
- Public reactions/access to the crime
- Resources for help/avenues of justice available to the victim(s)


## Actor-network Theory
- **Agency**
	- Human and non-human actors are assigned agency and are both complicit
	- Objects have a crucial function, but they also interact with humans and with other non-humans. Things are more than 'commodities'
	- Objects *do not* have a will of their own or have an intentionality in the same manner as humans. BUT they might act differently than anticipated
- **Association**
- **Techno-social**



### Hybrid Perpetrators
If both the human and the platform can both be complicit for harm, then we might refer to that as a **hybrid perpetrator**

We can also extend this to a **hybrid victim**. 
An example is the burning down of the Library of Alexandria, the loss of knowledge being considered a non-human victim.


Could, for example, Facebook be deterred if we give them a massive enough fine?
*Facebook data privacy violation fines*

How should the digital public be protected from harm?
