# Materialism

**Different schools of though around how we should regard the relationship between humans and the world around them**

## Old
- Believe that only humans have agency, and that 'things' are completely passive. So only humans can act on, use, and change the nature of 'things'
## New
- Believe that 'things' can have agency too, because 'things' can also act on humans and change their nature.

It helps us see a more complete picture of digital dynamics:
- Rather than only analysing the 'user'


**Technology can change or amplify how pre-existing/physical crimes/harms are committed**
