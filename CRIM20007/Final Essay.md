# Topic:
***Question 3***
“...We’re trying to empty an **Olympic-sized swimming pool** with **a sponge**. That is what it is like. (Interviewee, Case Study A)” (Harkin et al, 2018: 523). Critically examine the role of cyberpolicing as a response to cybercrime and digital harm.


# Plan:

### Comparing cyber-crime to a swimming pool is implying it has defined boundaries, is transparent, and can eventually be emptied.
Has boundaries:
- There is a finite, definite amount  (no ambiguity)
Transparency:
- We can see how deep it is, and can claim that it's uniform in nature
Eventually be emptied:
- Using the sponge *will* work, it's a matter of time and funding (better tools = faster draining).

Case study:
- Hackers don't necessarily act with rationalism


### The 'sponge' analogy carries the assumption that regular policing can be adapted to the world of cyber-crime.

Further assumptions made:
- The tool (sponge) is definitely suited for the job, and 100% effective
- We can displace the crime/criminals to *somewhere else*

## Discussion Checklist
- [x] Intro stating position that the analogy is inaccurate, and reveals the inability of cyberpolicing to have a significant impact on the degree of cybercrime committed
- [x] Mention the rapidly increasing amount of cybercrime occurring (despite increasing resource being dedicated to policing)
- [x] Discuss the lack of new understanding of cybercrime leading to inadequate policing outcomes
**Case study time!!**:
- [x] Explain that the traditional method of reporting on crime no longer functions properly (thus the idea that the 'water' is transparent falls completely flat)
- [ ] Talk about the CJS assumption that actors behave rationally, which is evidently not true in the case of cybercrime (it should be incredibly easy to find hacking-related case studies that back this up)
