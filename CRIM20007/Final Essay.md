*Main statement:*
While technology does provide new ways of facilitating harm and justice as society becomes evermore interconnected, its impact on the perpetration of harm is far more significant than the provision of a new medium by which existing forms of harm and justice can be enacted. A consideration of actor-network theory suggests that the very existence of some technologies - regardless of their perceived neutrality - influences actors (people) to such a degree that it instigates entirely new forms of harm.
