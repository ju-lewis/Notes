### Layout
*Executive Summary:*
*Introduction:*
- Cryptocurrencies are inherently online and hence global currency systems
- They're not tied to a direct commodity
- Ownership is, to a degree, anonymised - as accounts (or wallets) are identified simply by a random string of numbers and letters and are not necessarily tied to an individual.
- A combination of this anonymity and online accessibility has led to a continual increase in purchases of illicit substances online. (*NEEDS CITATION*)

Here I want to try to raise a point about existing regulations to suggest they're not effective. (Try to find something with Monero)

I think Actor Network Theory can be introduced by stating that the very concept of having a mostly unregulated/anonymous currency makes purchasing illicit substances far more accessible/appealing - The currency has a form of agency here.

*Research and evidence:*
*Policy Recommendations:*
***I want to discuss regulation/reporting on behalf of exchanges, as that's the point of contact between $AUD and cryptocurrencies (with the exception of Monero????)***
*Conclusions:*
