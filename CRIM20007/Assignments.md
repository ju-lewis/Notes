Will growth in cryptomarkets *increase* the harms of illicit drugs?

### Main Policy Suggestion:
We should adopt a harm-reduction methodology:
**Why?:**
- By design cryptocurrency purchases are incredibly hard to track
	- It would be reasonably ineffective to attempt to enact preventative measures
- Even if we do manage to prevent the purchases of illicit substances via cryptocurrencies, whether through harsh scrutiny of crypto exchanges or systematically hunting down cryptomarkets, what would this do to acquisition methods of the substances?
	- The anonymity of cryptocurrencies and cryptomarkets can be said to make what were previously understood as simple tools to be agentic, in that they influence those with access to them in a form of **Actor-network Theory**.
- It is extremely unlikely it would result in a reduction in purchasing, it would simply transfer means to in-person sales or other, harder to find and consequently potentially less 'reputable' cryptomarkets.
- If we concede that illicit substances will be purchased regardless, we can shift our focus to educate and providing help avenues for those who purchase and take these substances.

### Layout
*Executive Summary:*
*Introduction:*
- Cryptocurrencies are inherently online and hence global currency systems
- They're not tied to a direct commodity
- Ownership is, to a degree, anonymised - as accounts (or wallets) are identified simply by a random string of numbers and letters and are not necessarily tied to an individual.
- A combination of this anonymity and online accessibility has led to a continual increase in purchases of illicit substances online. (*NEEDS CITATION*)

Here I want to try to raise a point about existing regulations to suggest they're not effective. (Try to find something with Monero)

I think Actor Network Theory can be introduced by stating that the very concept of having a mostly unregulated/anonymous currency makes purchasing illicit substances far more accessible/appealing - The currency has a form of agency here.

*Research and evidence:*
*Policy Recommendations:*
*Conclusions:*
