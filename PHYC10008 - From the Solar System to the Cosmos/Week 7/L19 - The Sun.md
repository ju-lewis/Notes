**Important Points**
- How does the Sun generate its energy?
	- Particle physics and fusion
- Following energy outward from the core
- Visible layers of the Sun
- The Sun-Earth connection

## What is the Sun?

### Composition
- 91% Hydrogen
- 8.9% Helium
- 0.1% Everything else


**How is it producing energy?**

Theories:
- Chemical burning
	- Sun would only last 2000 years!
- Shrinking from gravitational contraction
	- $mgh \mapsto \text{thermal energy}$
	- Would last ~20,000,000 years
- Nuclear fusion!
	- $E = mc^2$
	- Far higher energy density than chemical reactions
		- Burning gasoline = $5\times 10^7$ Joules/kg
		- p-p chain fusion $4H \rightarrow He = 6.5\times 10^{14}$ Joules/kg

## Atomic Structure
- Atomic number $Z$ = number of protons
- \# protons = # electrons
- Mass number $A$ = number of nucleons



## Nuclear Fusion
- Strong Force holds nuclei together, but only over short distances $\approx 10^{-15}m$
- Electromagnetism pushes protons apart (like charges repel)
- Must overcome energy barrier


Atomic nuclei are positively charged, thus repel each other
At low speeds:
- Low speeds - electromagnetism prevents collision
- High speeds - nuclei come close enough for the strong force to bind

### p-p Chain Fusion

IN:
- 4 protons
OUT:
- 1 $^4He$ nucleus
- 2 photons (gamma rays)
- 2 positrons
- 2 neutrinos

Total input mass = total output mass + energy
$$4.000\text{ protons} \rightarrow 3.972\text{ protons} + \text{energy}$$

### Fusion in the Sun's core
Gravity crushes the core to high pressures and temperatures $\approx 15\text{ million K}$
$4H \rightarrow  {^4He}$ (p-p chain fusion)
Energy from fusion heats the rest of the star

Neutrinos observed on Earth are direct evidence for fusion in the core.

**Neutrinos**
- Extremely small mass 
	- Travel close to speed of light
- Almost don't interact with other matter
	- Passes through the Sun and Earth without interacting
- Extremely abundant
	- $10^{38}$ produced by Sun every second
	- $10^{15}$ passes through you every second


We detect neutrinos with massive tanks deep underground
- Only observe a few collisions each day


### Gravitational  Equilibrium
Nuclear fusion creates pressure
Gravity binds star together

Fusion rate is very sensitive to temperature
- More fusion -> hotter -> even more fusion -> even hotter -> ....

Why isn't there a runaway reaction?
- Increased rate -> increased pressure -> larger star
- Larger star is cooler -> fusion rate decreases -> star contracts again


## Energy Transmission


How does energy leave the core of a star?

### Radiative Zone

Gamma ray photons travel via *radiation*
- Interior of Sun is very dense - photons can't go further than ~1mm before absorption
- Energy is continuously absorbed and re-emitted
	- "Randomly walk" out of the Sun over time
	- It take ~100,000 years for energy to leave the Sun!!!


### Convection Zone
Eventually, the gas has cooled to roughly a few million K
- No longer redirects photons, absorbs them
Heat travels via *convection*
- Hot regions rise
- Cool regions sink
- Energy is carried as heat

### Photosphere
Temperature $\approx$ 6000K

Photons can leaved the Sun
- Cooled to 5800K (now visible)

Photosphere is the "visible surface" of the Sun


The photosphere is *granulated*
- ~1000-2000km across
- Only last 8-15 mins
Granulation is a product of convection

**Sunspots** are dark, cooled spot.


Magnetic fields trap gas in huge bubbling loops
- "Liftoff" areas cause dark (cool) sunspots

**Differential Rotation** causes the 'buckling' magnetic field lines
- The Sun 'winds' itself up
- Causes Sunspot cycle

### Chromosphere
- Just above photosphere
- Very low density
- *Temperature goes back UP*
	- 6,000-10,000 K
- Heated by magnetic field?
- Produces emission spectra!

### Corona
- Temperature gets even HIGHER (~1,000,000 K)
- More magnetic heating (??)
- Extremely low density
- Origin of most of the Sun's X-rays



## Solar Wind

At the top of the corona, gas is hot enough to escape gravitational SOI
- Corona is 'evaporating'
- ~1 million tons/second
- Replenished from below
- Mostly protons and electrons

Blows through solar system at 400-800 km/sec


Most particles are deflected by Earth's magnetic field
- Rest are directed to poles

The **Heliosphere** is the extension of the solar wind
