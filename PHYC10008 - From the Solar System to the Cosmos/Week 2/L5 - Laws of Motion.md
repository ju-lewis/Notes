## Newton's 3 Laws
1. An object moves at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.
2. $F = ma$, $F = \frac{d\rho}{dt}$
3.  For every force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force.


## Conservation Laws

Most of the conservation laws were solidified by Emmy Noether

 - Mass-energy Equivalence
 - Momentum
 - Angular Momentum
 - Energy

### Noether's Theorem:
>[!cite] 
>Every *differentiable symmetry* of an action of a physical system has a *corresponding conservation law*.

**Examples of Noether's Theorem:**
- Physical laws obey invariance under physical translation, which implies conservation of momentum.
- A physical system behaves no matter how it is oriented in space; thus a tumbling asteroid conserves angular momentum
- Invariance with time implies conservation of energy



Orbits obey the conservation of angular momentum, and there are effectively no forces (torques) being applied to the Earth, so it continuous to rotate about its axis and orbit the Sun.

## Forms of Energy

### Thermal Energy
The collective kinetic energy of many particles
- Thermal energy is *related* to temperature but is not the same.
- Temperature is thee average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.

As thermal energy is the *total* kinetic energy in a substance, it depends on both *temperature* and *density*.
- A pot of boiling (100c) water has a lower temperature but higher thermal energy than a 200c oven

### Gravitational Potential Energy
On Earth: $E = mgh$
In space, an object or gas cloud has more gravitational potential energy when it is spread out than when it contracts.

A gas cloud collapses when gravitational potential energy exceeds its own 'pressure' (force of the particles holding the cloud)

#### Gas Cloud Collapse:
Gas clouds are not spherical, and collapse on their shorter side first.
As the mass approaches the centre on the short side, the rotation of the cloud speeds up along that axis.
- Gravitational potential energy is converted to thermal energy


### Conservation of Mass-Energy
Mass itself is a form of potential energy!
$E = mc^2$
When the sun shines, it loses mass

The total energy content of the universe was determined in the Big Bang and remains the same today.
