## Supernovae

Occur about 1 per century per galaxy
- Last one 'observed' in the Milky Way was 1604
- Last one we *know about* in the Milky Way was  1868

Sometimes visible during the day!

SN 1987A is the nearest visible supernova
- Started life as a 18 solar mass star
	- Exploded 11 million years ago
- In the Magellenic cloud
We know of hundreds of *supernovae remnants*

Supernovae in other galaxies are bright enough to be seen as a sudden, bright point
1 SN per 100 years => monitoring 100 galaxies should reveal 1 SN per year


**Without Supernovae, we would have nothing heavier than carbon.**


As elements above carbon result from helium capture, there are more elements with even atomic numbers than odd.


>[!example] Prediction
>If elements heavier than Fe result from brief explosions instead of constant fusion, they should be more rare than lighter elements.

>This can be observed to be true.


We have also observed massive numbers of neutrinos being released by SN 1987A
- Explained by rapid neutron core collapse 


### Metal Production and Recycling

We have now established a model where:
- stars are formed from interstellar gas clouds
- Small stars live for a long time - don't return elements to ambient
	- Hydrogen and helium is release, carbon is locked in white dwarfs
- Giant stars release massive elements back to interstellar medium

Supernovae -> stellar nebula


## Stellar Graveyards

### White Dwarfs

Formed by lower mass stars (M < $8 \ M_{sun}$)

Effectively an inert white rock that slowly cool down
- Hot core of carbon

Density - $1cm^3$ is about 5 tons
- Held up by electron degeneracy pressure

We don't have 'light' white dwarfs because the universe is too young


### Neutron Stars

Balanced by neutron degeneracy pressure

$M_{\text{Neutron Star}} \approx 1.5 \times M_{Sun}$

Solid crust (~1km thick)
*Diameter is only **20km***
Spin very rapidly
- Conservation of angular momentum
- Angular momentum is lost as mass is radiated away
	- Slower rotators are older

**Pulsars (Rapidly Rotating Neutron Star)**
Radiation is *beamed* from the poles
- A pulsar was discovered in Crab Nebula (known supernovae remnant)



### Black Holes
Massive stars

Gravity so strong, it surpasses any kind of pressure
