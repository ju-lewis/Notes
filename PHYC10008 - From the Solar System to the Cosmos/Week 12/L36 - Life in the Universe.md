## The Fate of the Universe
Future expansion depends on how *exactly* dark energy behaves
### A Simple Possibility - Heat Death

Constant dark energy continuous to accelerate the universe
Hubble constant grows until even nearby galaxies are redshifted into oblivion

$t \approx 10^{12}$ year - universe is expanding so quickly that everything outside the Milky Way has moved beyond the horizon
- Everything eventually stops (Big Chill)


## What is Life?

It's hard to define, but some common elements are:
- Order
- Reproduction
- Growth and development
- Energy utilisation
- Response to environment
- Evolutionary adaptation


**Key Ingredients**
- Source of nutrients
- Energy (specifically an energy gradient)
- Liquid water
	- Or other means of transport for nutrients, waste, etc.


### Other things we don't know:
- What is dark matter?
- What is dark energy?
- Why matter not anti-matter?
- What caused inflation?
- What is the fate of the universe?

## The Copernican Principle
We are not in the centre of the universe
The universe appears to be the same everywhere
The laws of physics are the same everywhere


### The Fine-Tuning Problem
Why do physical constants have the values that they have?

Our universe appears to be precisely optimised for complex life

What would happen if the "*6 important numbers*" changed?
- Relative strength of gravity
	- Gravity is by far the weakest force ($10^{39} \times$ weaker than EM for hydrogen atom)
- Ratio of neutron/proton mass
	- Neutrons are 0.1378419% heavier than protons
	- If neutrons were heavier, they would decay too quickly to form helium
	- If protons were heavier, P-P fusion wouldn't produce meaningful energy
- Dark matter density
- Dark energy density
- $Q$: Strength of Primordial Density Contrast
	- Density perturbations in the CMB
- $D$: Number and type of dimensions


#### Simple Solution: The Strong Anthropic Principle
The universe was *designed* with intelligent life in mind
- The "goal" of the universe is to foster intelligent life

We really can't claim much more than this.


#### The Weak Anthropic Principle
Our universe is a selection bias

No matter how unlikely it may be, the only universe we *can* inhabit is a finely-tuned one

#### The Self-Explaining Universe
The universe *can only* exist when observed.


#### Quantum Worlds
The universe "branches" at every chance
- Every possible universe exists simultaneously
Overlapping realities do not communicate



We are limited by our human perception of the universe.
