## The Death of Massive Stars ($\gt 20 M_{Sun}$)
Collapse of a massive star *core*
- Concentrates all the mass into a single point

Space time continuum is **torn**!
- Singularity is created


## Escape Velocity
Recall that orbital velocity is independent of orbiter characteristics.
$$v_{\text{circular}} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}$$
For a parabolic escape orbit, the velocity required is:
$$v_{\text{escape}} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$

**What is the escape velocity of a black hole?**
- Decreasing radius at constant central mass increases escape velocity
- Eventually not even light can escape


The 'surface' of a black hole defined by its **Schwarzschild radius** is called the event horizon.
- Not a surface, just a dark outline.

$$R_{\text{Schwarzschild}} = \frac{2GM}{c^2} = \text{3 km per solar mass}$$  

### Tidal Force: Spaghettification
Tidal force near event horizon for a stellar Black Hole is very strong

The change in gravitational attraction over small distances is so great that differential forces can tear any object apart.

Large black holes have lower tidal forces (as a result of larger radius)
- Supermassive black holes often have tidal forces less than Earth's surface gravity


### Observing Black Holes

How do we observe objects that emit no light?


**Black Hole Binaries**
- More massive star evolves faster, may become black hole
- Look for remaining star orbiting 'invisible point'
- Gas goes from companion star into the black hole
	- Accretion disk


**Supermassive Black Holes**
Orbit speeds become very large for stars at centre of some galaxies
Must be something very small and very massive in the centre

- We've observed stars orbiting around Sagittarius A* !!
	- Star S0-2 has a *galactic* orbital period of 15.2 years
	- Pericenter of only 17 light hours!
		- Requires M=$4.3\times 10^6 M_\text{Sun}$
