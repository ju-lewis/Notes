## Relative densities
$\rho = \frac{M}{V}$

We often work out density as a ratio compared to Earth's density:

>[!example]
>$\rho_{Saturn} = 0.15 \rho_{Earth}$


## Densities of different materials

| Material     | Density (gm/cm^3) |
| ------------ | ----------------- |
| Water Ice    | 0.94              |
| Liquid Water | 1.00              |
| Rock         | 2.7-3.7           |
| Iron         | 7.8               |

## Earth's interior
- **Core**: Highest density; nickel and iron
- **Mantle**: Moderate density, silicon, oxygen, etc.
- **Crust** Low density; granite, basalt, etc.

We can use our knowledge of Earth's interior to tell us what the interiors of other planets may be like. *(e.g. Mars has a greater lithosphere)*

## Differentiation
- Gravity pulls high-density material to planetary centre
- Lower-density material 'floats' to surface

## Lithosphere
- A planet's outer layer of cool, rigid rock is its **lithosphere**
- It "floats" on the warmer, softer rock beneath it


How do we know about these regions without direct observation?
### Seismic Waves
- **P** waves are longitudinal ('pressure' wave)
- **S** waves are transverse 

![[Seismic Waves.png]]

How do we differentiate between them?

**P** waves travel through Earth's core, but **S** waves do not.
- We can then conclude that Earth's core must have a liquid outer layer

### Why is Earth's core hot?

In planetary formation:
- Accretion
- Differentiation
Both involve matter losing gravitational potential energy and gaining kinetic energy.
**Now radioactive decay in the Earth's core is the primary source of heat.**

Over time, the planet's interior cools through the process:
1. Convection transports hot material to the surface and cool material to the core
2. Conduction transfers heat from hot material to cool material
3. Radiation sends energy into space.

### How fast do astronomical bodies cool?
It depends on their surface area to volume ratio

Volume (contained heat) increases with the *cube* of the radius 
Surface area (ability to radiate) increases with the *square* of the radius

So, bigger bodies cool much more slowly

We consider the Moon *geologically dead* as there is no more heat transfer


## Why do some planets have magnetic fields?

Magnetic fields are created by the motion of charged particles

Requirements:
1. Molten, electrically conducting interior (hot iron core)
2. Convection
3. Moderately rapid rotation


### Movement of magnetic poles
Subduction of crust material changes the flow of core material, resulting in changing of magnetic fields (polarity can reverse!!)

The magnetic field strength varies
- On Earth, the South Atlantic Anomaly is an area of weak magnetic field over South America

We have geologic evidence the Earth's magnetic field has reversed before!

The magnetic north pole has 'wandered' almost 20 degrees over the last century *(10-15 km/year)*

## Planetary Surfaces

Four main processes shape surfaces:
1. Impact cratering
	1. Most cratering occurred in the early solar system
	2. Craters are typically 10x the size of the object that made them
2. Volcanism
	1. Volcanism happens when molten rock (magma) finds a path through the lithosphere to the surface
	2. Molten rock is *lava* after it reaches the surface
	3. **Runny lava** forms lava plains **Thick lava** forms *stratovolcanoes*
	4. Outgassing is the process of releases gases from Earth's interior into the atmosphere
3. Tectonics
	1. Convection of the mantle creates stresses in the crust (tectonic forces)
	2. *Compression* of crust creates mountain ranges
	3. *Tension* of crust creates valleys
4. Erosion
	1. Weather-driven processes that break down rock
	2. Can only happen if there is an *eroding agent* (water, ice, atmosphere)
