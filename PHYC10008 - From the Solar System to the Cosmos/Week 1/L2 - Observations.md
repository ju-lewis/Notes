## Modern science's ancient origins

**Earliest recorded observations - supernova:**
- Indian observers viewed and recorded HB9 in 4500 $\pm$ 1000 BC
- Rock carvings
- 'Two suns'


### Monuments record astronomical events:
- Stonehenge was constructed over many millenia from ~8000BC
	- Claimed to have some astronomical significance for solar events
	- Likely had spiritual significance as well

### Antikythera Mechanism:
- In 1900, remnants of an analogue computer from ~100BC capable of computing moon phases, eclipses, and other astronomical events were found in Greece.

### Greek Astronomy:
- In c. 240 B.C. Greek astronomers computed the circumference of Earth to be 42,000km (compared to the modern value of 40,000km)

### Ptolemaic Model of the Solar System:
- A geocentric model
- Good enough to use for 1500 years

### Islamic Astronomy:
- Flourished from 1025-1450 AD
- Kept Greek astronomy alive
- Developed doubts about Ptolemaic (geocentric) world view

#### Copernicus:
In 1543 Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model of the Solar System.
The model was no more accurate than the Ptolemaic model as a result of assuming circular orbits, and was not widely accepted.

#### Tycho:
Tycho compiled the most accurate description of planetary motion.

#### Kepler:
Kepler first tried to perform calculations with the previously accepted circular orbits, which resulted in an 8 arcminute discrepancy in calculations and observations.

#### Galileo:
Observed the 4 moons of Jupiter, and used their orbit around Jupiter to disprove the geocentric model.

**Phases of Venus:**
- Discovered in 1610
- Changes in angular size with phase showed Venus did not orbit Earth


## Key Elements of a Scientific Theory:
- Observation $\rightarrow$ natural explanation
- As simple as possible (Occam's Razor)
	- "Plurality should not be posited without necessity"
- Testable predictions
- A theory must:
	- Explain things simply
	- Be supported by lots of evidence
	- Not fail any important tests
