## Hubble's Law
Redshift $\propto$ Distance

Remember, the expansion of the universe isn't an explosion moving the galaxies through spacetime
- Spacetime itself is expanding

That's what the velocity is *apparent recessional velocity*
- Hence we can have expansion faster than the speed of light (since no movement is occurring)
- There is no 'centre of the universe'!

Cosmological redshift and kinematic redshift manifest in identical ways


Redshift describes the proportionality between wavelength now compared to wavelength at the time of emission
$$1+z=\frac{\lambda_{now}}{\lambda_{then}}$$


An interesting quirk of redshift and expansion is that we're falling *towards* the virgo cluster at $\approx 300km s^{-1}$, yet it appears *redshifted* at $\approx 1500 km s^{-1}$

We can use redshift to compute the change in distance since the emission of light
$$\frac{R_{then}}{R_{now}}=\frac{1}{1+z}$$
